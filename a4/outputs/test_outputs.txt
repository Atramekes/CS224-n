You know what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, I probably am the author for kids, over the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want to look like like a scientist.
I can be <unk> as <unk> or <unk> <unk> and no no one has been a <unk>
I'm here here to talk about about <unk> and <unk>
And you know that a <unk> is still something that was turned up in some place.
You just have to give the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of a complicated circle that I'm going to speak.
My circle started in the years, in the middle school, in the middle school, in the middle school, where I was the weird of the class.
At the age that we were able to bring up to a bunch of a week in the center of the kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life to let me go into the center of the <unk>
I did it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to get out of the city.
I had a boss, and over dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a <unk> -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working working in organizations who were dying against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half the night I got a phone called a phone called that <unk> <unk> who said, "I want to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults never got to us.
You could be <unk> and please make that man that I know that you've already been done.
And I have to tell you that I have breast cancer, and I'd like to get it to this for you?
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we went to see, and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and we took them out of his family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And so as the woman who wanted to be <unk> as the Chinese came to <unk> it became a <unk> box and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been <unk> it had become a circle -- and that one of the ones who talked to talk about it in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I have a lot of it.
And you know that part of the life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs true and science, and I'm very happy that today I talked about this.
They also need -- you need to rethink love and we pleasure. And it's our job to provide those things.
Thank you.
As a artist, the connection is very important for me.
On my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not sold from nature and that everything is the same.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what I was in front of me.
So we know that my <unk> around the water is almost 60 feet. And I couldn't even think that it was about a <unk> on the second of the snow on the day in snow year after a year.
The <unk> are born when they sit out of the glaciers or they bring them out the barriers of ice.
Every <unk> has their own individual personality.
They have a different way to interact with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them will be <unk> and you see it into the end, as the other can't be <unk> and you get it into a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, to see a <unk> that are <unk> and they were able to see us as much as human.
But the reality is all the opposite.
As a <unk> I am <unk> your atmosphere <unk>
As a <unk> it takes a <unk> and the rich water in tradition, that feeds many ways of life.
I took me to photograph these <unk> as if you get from the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these moments only there are the only one of that way and you're not going to exist on that way.
It's not the death when they <unk> it is not a end, but one of your way for the cycle of life.
Over the ice of the <unk> which is really <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100 billion years.
The last pictures that I'd like to show you are a <unk> I photographed in <unk> Pakistan.
It is a little bit less likely to see a <unk>
Here you have.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like to pay attention to the way of the <unk> and its line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the ship has moved into the other side and the man is there.
This is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> from the water about 400 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the <unk> shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, the same day, each of the <unk>
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want to take it too much in the details, because if you stop to think about the conception in here, because if you try to think about the conception in yeah, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a time.
And in this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm came up to the ground,
And in the other case, the <unk> of the sperm came up to the ground,
They were both <unk> and it starts life.
We can talk about them more late.
In my brain activity to build two <unk>
In one of my <unk> work with the story of <unk>
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people are going to take the anatomy -- and I mean, how people have been able to be <unk> the idea of the <unk> what have thought about the body.
The other role that life in my work is the <unk> as a <unk> of patients or like I say, <unk> <unk> of people who are the medical people.
In this case, I've been working with people who are the physical features our social rights.
I've been working for example, with <unk> <unk> two people within a same body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people a lot more dangerous than a half.
And I've been working with many cases of people with sex <unk> individuals whose physics and the physics is not going to be in the <unk> and <unk> <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I'm going to give you some examples of ways to have a sex that is not going to be <unk> in the rich ways or <unk>
For example, it's the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose gene gene -- and he says to the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that they all have in the <unk> life, they get <unk>
And then, in the <unk> life make the <unk> they make <unk>
But since this individual <unk> <unk> <unk> the body doesn't get to the same.
It's <unk> <unk>
And so, there are the high levels of <unk> but without it.
As a result, the body uses when a course is still <unk>
When you <unk> the baby has to be able to get out of me.
It's a girl. It's <unk> as a child.
And often, it is not but until you know, when it's growing and developing the <unk> but it doesn't have the <unk> period when somebody gives you that something is going on.
And then you try to ask them that you can realize that instead of having <unk> and actually it actually has <unk> and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think about a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women like men, as the men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the end of the body.
<unk> <unk> make <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like I -- I think a <unk> woman doesn't know the <unk> structure, I think it's a typical woman -- most of the women as I are <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we know the <unk>
As a result, somebody like the brain has the fastest brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> which has the <unk> <unk>
So sex is something simple, not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way you can be everywhere.
Another example: I got a few years ago, I got a call from the age of 19 years born and raised as <unk> I had a <unk> and small relationships with her, he had a life and I had had just to discover that I had <unk> and <unk>
I had a similar way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had the 20th century and in the 1960s, the <unk> <unk> were so active that, in fact a lot of an active environment -- and we basically make a negative environment.
As a result, the <unk> were <unk> their brain was exposed to the component of <unk> <unk>
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> anything.
And it was at 19 years when they started to have a medical problems that was going to be able to be the <unk> <unk> when doctors found that, in fact, it was a woman for inside.
Well, another example of a <unk>
Some people with New York, you develop what it knows like <unk> is I mean, they have <unk> <unk> in tissue <unk>
We don't know good for what happens.
So there's a lot of sex.
The reason that kids with this kind of bodies you have to be <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> is not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have a
In many cases people are perfectly serious.
The reason that you are going to get up in a few surgeries is that they're a threat for our social <unk>
The system is based usually in the idea that a particular ant brings <unk> a particular eye.
We have the idea that being woman is to have a woman to be <unk> <unk> <unk> being black wants to say that we have an African act in terms of it.
A big idea.
And when you think about a body that shows something pretty different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk>
Imagine the amazing thing that is to have children who are born as two people within a same body.
The recent case is in the year of the year of the year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> put in the <unk> of the <unk> their sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of galaxies called me to ask, "What is you going to do to determine if you <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain the bees that there is no way to us.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature is not going to admit that nature didn't explain a <unk> line between men and women and women and women and women and women and <unk> we are us who we build that line.
So what we have is a situation where the most comes to science, the more we have to admit that these <unk> we thought was <unk> <unk> which was <unk> directly with <unk> <unk> <unk> are a lot more <unk> of what they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
And also in terms of race, something that turns up much more complicated than the <unk>
As we see, we put them into a <unk>
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 70 percent of DNA with the <unk>
What did you <unk> the fact of the fact about the fact about a few <unk>
And as we <unk> in science we took us every time more in a visual area, where we have to recognize that the <unk> <unk> which is probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all the life of human life.
One of them, for example, in our physical culture in the United States of today, are the rise to the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to find a moment of which a body has human costs and has different rights to the <unk>
There are a lot of <unk> today in the day <unk> not in the audience, but I know within the <unk> about when somebody would be built dead.
Our ancestors had never had to be <unk> with this question if somebody was dead.
As a lot of you put a <unk> in front of the nose and if it was still <unk>
If I was going to move it on the <unk>
But today, for example, we take organs from a body and put them into another body.
And as a result, we need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to figure out the death of somebody. And this makes us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple number of the past.
And you may think that this explosion of <unk> could be able to get somebody like me.
In politics I'm <unk> <unk> people with bodies but I have to admit that I put it up to me.
<unk> that these cases are much more than we thought about me.
<unk> from the view of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first I have to admit that I am a <unk> <unk>
I know that they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so <unk> and <unk> and so cool in what they did, I find every way to look at that music -- <unk> <unk> and not for music, which is completely <unk>
It's why happened in <unk> with <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> for me, the first activists of the anatomy and tell you why.
What they were <unk> was a <unk> concept and <unk> with another that it was radical and <unk> and turned up for 200 years.
And as you all remember what we were <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of the <unk> <unk> was actually in a very false concept of <unk>
The age of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right way.
They had the concept of blue <unk>
They were from the idea that it was going to be able to political power by the right to the right to the head of blood <unk> the father and then the son, etc.
<unk> <unk> <unk> that idea and the <unk> for a new concept and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the game of the game and they decided that the anatomy that it meant was the act in common and not the <unk> differences that was something very exciting.
And in the part of what they were doing because they took part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time you get the science.
And it comes very clear, if we look at the story of the <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> we were <unk> and <unk> the concept of being able to be able to be able to be a <unk> idea of a <unk>
They were moving into a <unk> concept
And if you look for example, the Declaration of the <unk> talk about nature and the God of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a result, we were going to be able to be able to be able to be <unk>
And at doing that, they were <unk> the world of the future civil rights movement.
I didn't think about that way, but they did it for us and was cool.
And what happened.
And women are <unk>
Then he came out of the success of the modern rights movement with people from the <unk> rights <unk> who said, "It's not a <unk>
We found men in the front of the national rights movement who said, "I'm a man.
Again, people from the color that <unk> the <unk> <unk> about the difference <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same with <unk>
The problem is, of course, that as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we do certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give you a fish to the same rights than a human.
I don't want to say that we had to be <unk>
I don't want to say that to the age of five years they had to allow them to have sex to have sex or they get back.
There are some <unk> <unk> that to me have sense and I think we should think of <unk>
But the challenge is trying to discover what they are, why do they keep them and if they have sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> <unk>
We have two <unk> both <unk> both <unk> on the same day.
Let's imagine that one of them, they were born three months ago before the one of the age of <unk>
Let's take it through the contrary, he was born in <unk> was born the one of <unk>
On the only fact that I was born three months before Mary came up with all the rights three months before Henry -- the right of three months before Henry -- the right of the <unk> the right of the <unk> the right of the <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different age but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> in relationship to their rights.
You can be considered to be considered a man -- I don't know if it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man -- it's now <unk> from the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
It doesn't have the same rights for marriage that Henry in all of the states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So I still <unk> <unk> that in several aspects are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is: What do we do now that science is so much in the field of the anatomy that we came to the point that a democracy would have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give your science, but at the same time I feel like science is going to be <unk>
Where are we going on.
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of attitude <unk> "Well, we have to see the line in some part, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are inspired in a weird position.
For example: Texas in a moment has decided that to marry a man there is not that you have to have the <unk> and that to marry a woman there is that we have to have a <unk>
Now in the practice they don't make them <unk> to people.
But this is also very strange because the story who told you to the beginning of the <unk> <unk>
If we look at one of the founders of American democracy -- Dr. Martin Luther Luther King in her <unk> <unk> <unk> a solution.
He said that we should judge the people <unk> not in the color of its skin, but in the content of its <unk> going beyond the <unk>
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea seems very exciting.
But in practice, how do you do that?
How do you judge people in the base of its <unk>
I want to point that I was also sure that we had <unk> in this for <unk> rights for people, because I think I know that I know about some <unk> <unk> that probably we probably deserve more social services than some humans who know.
I also want to say that maybe a few <unk> I know that you can take more decisions -- smart and <unk> about their sex relationships that I know.
So how do you put the subject of the content of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And a part of me is a question what if the character of a person could be going on the future to be able to be able to be able to be the <unk>
We want to really get to that way.
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States are going to have been going to get this kind of thinking in relation to the democracy.
We've made a good job in the democracy and I think we will do a good work in the future.
We don't live for example, in a context like the <unk> where a man who feels like to be known for other men is <unk> of being <unk> to be willing to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to live.
We're not in that situation.
I say that we don't have a context as the one of a surgeon that I talked about a couple years ago that I had done a couple years ago that had done a couple years ago that I had made a couple years ago that I had done a couple years ago that I had done a couple years ago that I had made a couple years ago that
But when the phone asked him the reason of the operation -- it was a very <unk> operation who told me that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and so I had to do it.
So I said, "Well, has been considered the political <unk> instead of the <unk> <unk>
The United States has huge possibilities to the people to be who they are without <unk> to change the <unk>
So I think we have to be on your head.
Well, I want to say that I've been talking about a lot of <unk>
And I want to think about how we would be democracy, or as it might be <unk> if we have been given to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a <unk> and it's that I think you can have different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking in group.
And since a few years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in doing the sex difference.
And one of the things that has been interested are the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about the <unk> studies is that women, in average, not -- but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have a interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was in the school, one of my <unk> I knew that I was interested in <unk> <unk> I thought I was <unk> as <unk> I did a <unk>
<unk> what is <unk> <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most important question I've heard.
<unk> has to see with <unk> <unk> <unk> so there is nothing in the <unk>
But the most I've thought about their question, more has been like there is something in the <unk>
I mean, I could have something, in average, something different between the solar brain, and the male that makes us more <unk> to social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if you look at it, they were very lucky to find the way to protect the way to protect people from the ocean is possible that you have to be <unk> the concept of protection to this concept, maybe we would have the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that is what we have to do in the future when we get the democracy beyond the <unk> to think less in the individual body in terms of identity and think more in relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> let's think what about the others.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided that we had to convey how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where every family thinks where you want to go to live and work, it has the possibility to choose between the least a bunch of cities that are places that are places that are places that are places that are places that are places that are places that are places that are places that are dying to bring a new
Well, in this moment we're far from that goal.
There are thousands of millions of people in developing countries who don't know with a single city <unk>
But the astonishing of the cities is that it makes a lot more than their cost of construction cost to build it.
So you can easily be able to get it into the world that we can be able to get up to the world -- maybe we have a lot of new cities.
Well, this can be designed if I've never thought about new cities.
But you just just take it for the <unk>
Imagine that the half of the who would want to live in work, because they were all the way to the other half of them to do it.
You might try to increase the ability to be able to increase it in all the buildings themselves.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that are all the rules and the areas that are all rules to avoid the <unk> and the rhythms of building construction.
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a completely new place to build a completely new building building a completely new, always and when the rules of that place -- the building instead of <unk>
So I proposed that the government <unk> new areas of poor enough to create cities and gave them a <unk> cities in <unk>
More later I learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of <unk>
Did you know that every year about 75 <unk> <unk> from his country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what those people could do to make sure that those people could stay and make those same things in all.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> country for a <unk> crisis.
In the next <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform where they <unk> but at the same time.
He asked them to <unk> that was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was doing me to give a talk to give you a talk in home?
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a great amount of applications with <unk> I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities in <unk> to their more <unk>
The first point was the importance of predictions like those rules that you can't go on and it comes to all the <unk> <unk>
It takes a lot of attention to the new technologies, but you need to be so much of technologies like rules for <unk> and usually are the rules that are going to go back to you.
In the end of the 2010, a friend of <unk> sent them to <unk> a link with <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They told me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we found them in humanity, in a hotel room in a TED room.
I tried to tell you this point about the valuable thing that are the cities, much more valuable than its cost <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of the way in a place like New York.
But it was a pretty long discussion and in some time, when there was a <unk> <unk> he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk was inspired in very simple terms that a <unk> city is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> where it starts with <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules you can choose if you want to go or not live under those rules.
So the president of <unk> I told me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this might be the way to be the way that our country will do.
He asked me to be <unk> and I talk about the four and five of <unk>
So I took another talk with data, which was a picture like this, which was a picture like this, I was going to explain that for a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new <unk> who was built in <unk>
And just this will just get up over 100 miles old.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city and you have to start with a place that is going to be able to be able to be able to take it for least a <unk>
That's more than 100 degrees.
All the world <unk> <unk>
The face of the audience were very expensive and <unk>
The leader came up to the platform and he said, <unk> <unk> thank you a lot for your talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have here in my <unk>
So I felt and showed me the <unk>
And this says, <unk> that a new city can provide new options for people.
It would be a option of a city that you might go to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles from the West towards the West.
And they also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government had aid from the <unk> countries could benefit from the countries associated out of the countries associated and do the rules of the <unk> so that they all could be able to trust the <unk> <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be a lot of a thousand miles old.
And a little bit later, the age of India, they found in Congress to get her <unk> and add a lot of <unk> that they could create these basic regions of development.
In a country that I was just going to go through this crisis <unk> the rise in Congress for this <unk> <unk> was <unk>
All of them are all <unk> in society, the <unk>
For <unk> in the <unk> you have to take two times in Congress.
The 17 of February became another time in another <unk> <unk>
And after the middle of the <unk> from the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of 30 <unk> was the two places in the world that are more interested in participate in the building of cities.
One of them is South Korea,
This is a picture of a new new center of the city that is building in North Korea is bigger than the center of Boston.
All that you see there was built in four years after it took four years ago after the <unk>
The other country interested in the building of cities is <unk>
In fact, we've already built two cities in China and they're being used for a <unk>
And if you think about this, this is the point where we are.
They have a space and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They're putting a legal system that would be able to be able to be the <unk> system and then it would be able to play under a legal system.
A country has been committed to allow your Milky Thank it is the <unk> <unk> for this new <unk> system.
There are <unk> and thousands of cities who are very interested in the project.
You can even get some of the <unk>
But the only thing we know that you have been solved is that they have a good number of <unk>
There are a lot of companies that you want to focus on the <unk> especially in a place with a <unk> area and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say you would like to change it to the other place.
There's a million year that comes from Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to go back to their family to go to the family to go to a work, sometimes they have to win the money so just eat or buy it.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or you build a dozen these or a hundred years of these all the world?
What it seems to think about <unk> so that families can choose to make a lot of cities that are dying to bring up to new <unk>
This is a idea that's worth spreading.
And my friends were <unk> I asked me to say, "Thank you.
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before you show you what you are, I'm going to do this -- I'm going to do a public issue, and it's that, alive with <unk>
I love to find, <unk> <unk> and more recently, he looked at my blog <unk> <unk> and different for every time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes, is a second hand of markets from <unk> and <unk>
Oh, much.
The second hand, they allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I'm going to know the <unk> people -- all my money is going to a good <unk>    and buy it into my personal quest of <unk>
I mean, what I'm going to find today?
I will be about my mother."
I'm going to be <unk>
It cost less than 20 percent.
If all the answers are fun. I feel that I've invented.
And back to the subject of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was <unk> for this exciting week in TED.
I mean, what leads to somebody who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I did.
I've got a seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
<unk> in order to exactly a week is all that I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find all the other things that I would want to use after a <unk>
And because I don't know like the woman who walk over the TED --   -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now for this week.
It doesn't sound <unk>
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons that I think or not, I've learned in this kind of life that I think or not, I've learned in this kind of not using their new water.
Let's start with <unk>
I call this <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see.
Almost you can always see about 50 dollars.
All of the <unk> including me <unk> and it's the most expensive that I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be wrong -- when you're a <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to take other people happy.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life, trying to be just and at the same time.
I just know it.
If you get it out of the wrong people -- not just <unk> you can just be <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the boy who take inside.
Sometimes people told me that it seems to play to the <unk> or I remember my little seven years.
I like <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> is the key thing.
If you think you look good with something, it's almost sure they are.
And if you think you don't see good with something, probably it's also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't to the 30 years I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inside and outside, you don't see you can't be <unk>
So there's no excuse for one of this audience.
We need to be able to make everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth six words for you, <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without to say a word.
I tried one and again, when people came up to me this week just this week just that I was sick, and we had relatively fantastic.
Obviously all this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before you get home, I mean, I'm going to give you all of it.
Because the lesson that I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave back certain things.
I don't need to be <unk> with these things, because it goes back to the corner, there will be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there is a little love in my heart, and I look at it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can break in two parts.
The left side that is the <unk> and the right-hand side, which is the dark part.
So if you get a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a brain of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely <unk>
This would be somebody who is a completely <unk>
So what do you look at your brain in this <unk>
Some <unk> for one of these <unk> but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something like -- with a big observation in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's another <unk>
You can be crazy and <unk>
I think one of those people, that the most of the other physical physics <unk> we need a lot of logic for <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need pretty intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them to play with them and then we see it as <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same.
<unk> intuition that you can have developed with the step of the years is what it says that one thing can be just in a place at the time.
I mean, it can sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you didn't sit with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a boy playing in a bar of a <unk>
It was a small kid and I didn't do it very well, you always get <unk>
But I bet that the play with that bar of survey taught me a <unk> and it's that the great things don't allow them to the <unk> and they go on a place.
This is a big model that you can have in the world, except that you will be a <unk>
It would be a terrible model for a mental model that they don't play with <unk> <unk> play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, we found that they make all kinds of things really rare -- as you can go through the <unk> or you can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these <unk> and they called the theory of quantum quantum
In the point of the point of the physics was a few years old, you had to describe these small mechanics to describe those small particles.
But you don't need to describe the big objects that come around every day.
That is not very good to my own, and maybe it doesn't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes they play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen that.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it's not going to be good to my part of me.
Because if it all is made of small particles and all the small particles are still the principles of quantum mechanics -- then it doesn't have all to keep the principles of quantum mechanics,
I don't find the reason why you don't know.
And so I would feel a lot better if I could be able to prove that a common object also comes to the principles of quantum mechanics,
It's why some years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a <unk> <unk>
What we see here is a small chip chip here.
And you can try to see the green point right right at the middle of the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to get a little bit of a little bit in the center.
And then here we do this good good look at the small <unk>
What we see is a small little bit of <unk> and that it looks at a platform.
And then I did this almost about the same way you do a computer.
I went to a <unk> <unk> with an chip chip and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this <unk> with <unk> <unk> which is underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a <unk> <unk> but so it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make a <unk>
You know the uncomfortable that is being in a <unk>
I mean, when I am in a sudden, you do all kinds of complicated things, but then when other people can go back to do those things, because I don't want to be <unk> or really, I want to be <unk> or really, I want to be <unk> or really, I want to be <unk> or really, I want to be <unk> or really, I want to be <unk> or
The quantum mechanics says that the <unk> objects.
The friends of the <unk> objects are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> and the wind that happens to their side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to show the quantum mechanics -- we would have to put all the other <unk>
And that was what we did.
<unk> <unk> then <unk> a <unk> and we put it all the air, and then you put it up to a temperature of less than a degree for a <unk>
Now, to be just in the <unk> the small piece of metal is free to act as well.
And so we measure their movements.
And we found it in a very strange ways.
And instead of being perfectly recently, I was <unk> and the way that I was <unk> was like a breath of this way -- as a <unk> which is <unk> and <unk>
And to give you a <unk> that we could do that <unk> and they don't get to the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics -- something that just happens with quantum quantum
So what I'm telling you, is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and they didn't get to the same time.
Let's think about atoms.
In a case, all of the billion atoms that make that piece of metal and the same time these atoms are going to go up to go up and on the corner.
It's just in certain <unk> when those <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every order is in two different places at the same time, what it means that all the piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is cool.
All right.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> room to do this for all of those years. Because look at this, the difference in scale between a only taking and that little bit of metal is more or less than the difference between that child and you.
And so if you just take it to be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different different places, why can't you use it.
I mean, it's my logic that you talk about.
So you think if they were in several places at the same time, how do it would be that?
How do you take your awareness if your body is <unk>
There's another part of the story.
And it is when you put it up, and we put the lights and look inside the box, we saw the metal and look inside the box, we saw the metal was there in a single piece.
And I could go to this new <unk> <unk> all the objects in the elevator actually are just <unk> <unk> <unk>
You hear a lot of a lot about that quantum quantum mechanics that all is the same.
Well, that's not as well.
It's more than that is more than that, it's more different.
It's that those connections your connections to all the things that you are, literally define who you are, and that is the profound <unk> of quantum mechanics of quantum mechanics,
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And it makes 18 months ago, a other job in Google, until I put the idea of doing something related to <unk> and art to my head that is here and I allowed me to take them to it.
He took me 18 months ago.
A lot of <unk> and stories, it was <unk> with 17 <unk> very interesting countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is explains just in this slide and this is <unk>
I grew up in India.
<unk> from a great education -- but I didn't have access to many of these <unk> and works of art.
So when I started to travel and go back and go back to a minute, I started learning a lot.
And working in Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we did a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
You can be able to show the intuition to then you explain a couple of interesting things that we have moved from their <unk>
So let's go to <unk>
Look around all the <unk>
It's the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I actually just go to go on one of my favorite <unk> the museum of the art of New York.
There are two ways to do -- very simple.
We do it and <unk> we are in the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that actually doesn't matter.
You're going to move out there and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the <unk> and with a only branch of <unk>
They're where you want to go at the end of the <unk>
They're going to go back to the <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't got to do it.
Now I'm in front of my favorite paintings -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I see the <unk>
If the museum shows it the image, we do there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's the whole data of <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can do that, but I'm going to do this right now.
And this is one of the images that we call what we call the technology <unk>
So this image, for example, I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are a lot of people who say, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10 million <unk>
It can do it around very simple.
You see things that are happening.
I love this guy -- your expression has no price here.
But if you really want to be <unk>
So I started to play and I found it with something that was happening there.
And I said, "I think this seems <unk>
I found them and discovered that kids were actually playing to something.
I was a little bit, I talked about some people from the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is a <unk> with a <unk> with a <unk>
And it seems very popular.
I don't know why they do, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to bring it up even more in top and you'll see that you really can get even to the <unk>
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to show the image, so you'll see what it is.
Here's where we had and this is the painting.
The best thing is a second.
So now we are going to go back over over the next time in New York.
Here's another of my favorite <unk>
The example, I showed it was to find details.
But what happens if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how you're you're <unk> I actually created this work <unk>
And it goes up and really it really makes it <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this room, and I really just go to the <unk>
This is "the <unk> night, I think that I never seen it so before.
I'm going to show you some of my favorite functions.
There's a lot more things here, but I don't have time of <unk>
This is the really cool. It's called <unk>
All of you all of you, absolutely all of all, doesn't matter if it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that day.
You can actually create their own museum, create their own collection of all these images.
It's very simple, I call this function that I call "The power of the <unk> -- you just do a place around it.
It's about "The <unk> in the National coast, in London.
You can <unk> things, you send their friends and keep a conversation about what they feel <unk> these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main things is that all the incredible things is really not a Google of Google.
No, in my view, I even don't have a <unk>
Maybe it shouldn't say this.
It comes from these artists.
And that has been my best experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital environment, it makes a care of art and it's going to be involved in there.
And the great question that you do today is it made this to find this to find the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It is to preserve the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good <unk>
I have something to show you.
Think about a <unk> a <unk>
In our lab, we call it <unk> design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I am <unk> we all the kids in Italy, we grow with this picture in the wall of its "Hey, but the reason I show you this is that has happened something really interesting in the <unk> <unk> in the last two decades.
A few time, if you wanted to win a <unk> race -- one, you take a program and they put it into a good pilot and a good car, and a good car, a good car, and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot was good enough -- you put the career.
This is what's that, in engineering, it's <unk> system of control in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Today, the interesting is that the basic systems of control in real time are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, in the past years, have been covered of networks.
They are going to get computers on the air.
And as <unk> are starting to answer a different way and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is something big.
As you remember some other wanted to say that the cities are only the hundred percent of the cortex of the planet but represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and the 80 percent of the emissions of CO2.
If we could do something with cities, it would be big.
More beyond the cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are coming into our traditional objects.
This is a exhibition of <unk> <unk> for the end of year in <unk> during the summer.
It's called <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, you start <unk>
In some way, it's as if you almost all the atoms that are <unk> sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In some sense, it's almost like in the old dream of <unk>
You know, when I was <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> is said to the end of the <unk> and you put it into the sand -- you see you still can see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment started <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and put something.
Let's start with <unk>
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago, and a half years in Italy.
It was a summer with <unk>
It was the year in which he took the World Center on the World
Maybe some of you remember you were remember, they were <unk> and France, and the end of the end <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end won Italy.
Now let's see what happened to look at this day looking at activity in the network.
Here's the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The line of time is in the top.
At the late afternoon, there are people all here and there are doing <unk> <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people make a quick call and it's going to get a <unk>
Over the time of the time.
First time <unk>
<unk> and in a moment, the <unk>
He said, "Yes."
That night all came to <unk>
There you see the great same.
The next day they were all in the center of the British team, and the first minister then.
And then all the world.
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the age of <unk> people are going to <unk> is a big party, you can see the speed at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the city of the city of a way that we don't want to do just a few years ago.
Another example of <unk> is not about people, but of things that we use and <unk>
Today, we know everything about the <unk> of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the nerves that make a <unk> how do it <unk>
But we know very little about where they go things.
So in this project we develop a little bit of small <unk> and a little bit to track the trash in its own system.
We start with a few volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year, to see what they were <unk> different kinds of things, like you can see, things that are all <unk>
And then we put them a little chip, a <unk> and then we start <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
<unk> <unk>
After a week.
With this information we realized that there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
These are data that before it wasn't there.
They're happening very complicated things, and there are a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if we see all the days that the cup that the cup is that I was not going to be still in some place.
And that if the plastic bottle that we had a day still still still still there.
So if you show that people to people, then we can be able to promote some change.
That was the reason of the project.
My colleague of MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about <unk> and a lot of other different things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we heard in the beginning, which is <unk> about the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
They all started with a question of the mayor of the city that came and told us that Spain and the south of Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public spaces.
And the question is, how is the technology, the new technology, and the new technology, to meet that?
And one of the ideas that we develop in MIT, in a workshop was, imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is open and <unk>
It creates as a water of water, with <unk>
If you get the <unk> you can write in them, to show you simple images,
And you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do, as you see in the image.
We showed this to the mayor of <unk>
I felt a lot.
And it takes a <unk> to design the building to the <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no doors -- but when you find it together it opens up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered by water.
And if you have a little wind if you want to minimize the <unk> <unk>
Or you can close the building and the whole architecture is like in this case.
Those days will always be somebody, in the winter, when you go on the roof, somebody who was there, and he said, <unk> <unk>
No, it's not that they have <unk> but when you go on almost the whole architecture of the <unk>
Here's it in it.
You see the <unk> people for what's happening on it.
And here I'm just trying to don't get to test the sensors that open water.
I think it should tell you what happened a night when all the sensors stopped work.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came into the building because the way we interact was changed a little bit.
I was not a building who was used to try to ask it, but a building that was actually doing <unk> and holes of water and you had to go to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because like architects, Israel will always think about the use that people give us to our designs.
But then the reality is <unk>
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the <unk> <unk> <unk> and of course, about them.
And this is what we took us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those <unk> could start able to fly.
Imagine that they could have small <unk> in the air and each one had a little <unk> that changes of color as if it was a cloud that goes on space.
This is the video.
Imagine a situation like the ones that we saw before, which is moving with other in <unk>
We could make this cloud,
A kind of screen looks like this with a normal <unk> in two dimensions.
Or normal but in three dimensions, where it changes is the light, not the position of the <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen looks at different and <unk> in different types of <unk>
And then all of that I could be a <unk> cloud in 3D to which you can <unk> and you see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going back to the way to form a <unk> like before.
When the light, the light, you see this.
Imagine every one of them <unk> for a person.
We can have to have a <unk> with a chance that comes from people, the movement of people, and so forth.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the best dancers of <unk> today, the star of the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use it as <unk> for <unk>
Here we can see it <unk>
On the left you see the <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's so much a 3D time in real time.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the <unk> we can play with them, with the color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a <unk> possible for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the front of London.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine the other time, that we could get to the people to make something and change our environment that you do something and change our <unk> environment like <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last years, is that, in the last two decades, we spent the physical world to the digital world.
We've added everything, as knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the campaign of Obama is <unk> we can move from the digital world of the power of the power of the networks, in the physical world.
In our case, this can we use to design and make a <unk>
That means something built in a city.
But then, it can be to tackle the challenges of <unk> think about climate change or greenhouse emissions how go from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can do that people are going to do this together, in the collective way.
The cloud is a discovery again, made of the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but it covered out of <unk>
You can move out where you have different experiences.
It can see it from the way to share the main moments of the <unk> and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up as a new top of London.
You can get there.
And as if it was a new green <unk> in night, but most important is that being a new experience for anyone who will go to the top.
Thank you.
I would like to be better than they are.
So imagine that I told you that, with only a single changes in their genes, you can improve the <unk> for a more <unk> and more fast.
Or maybe you would like to be in better way, to be more <unk>
I would like to be more attractive and sure of it.
What would you live more with good light.
Or maybe they're all those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What do you think about it.
What can you be able to choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people are <unk>
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> you probably had to have a lot of creative people.
That's very good.
How many <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
What about the <unk>
Oh, people do me feel very well like a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
The evolution has been a <unk> topic here in the TED page but today I want to give you a doctor on a doctor about the issue.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> in the Pacific <unk> <unk> wrote a clinical trial in biology has sense with the light of the <unk>
But if you see the biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
It comes to the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this <unk> <unk> in the end is, of course, the most we're going to do.
<unk> from a common conversation with the modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
In the <unk> has been maybe 20  25 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some have been and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might look like we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in its most basic information of our cells is more or less than itself.
You realize that we can harness and control the source of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin which is used to try the <unk>
This is not like the human insulin but it's the same simple, <unk> of the ones that comes from the side.
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all took them in the more bacteria that cells who have in the rest of the side.
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, you think of -- when we said, <unk> you show you what the <unk> think about the <unk>
And the slide is a small environment <unk> for those bacteria.
It's <unk> <unk> is very <unk>
And we are going to provide all the nutrients that you can want to want to have no effort from its part.
It's really like a quick going to the bacteria with the <unk> <unk> of some <unk> <unk>
But, for all, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They are going to fill them out of <unk> nutrients and we protect them from certain disease.
But what do we give us the future?
We are in one kind of fundamental balance as a specific balance.
Or it takes it to become something else, something perhaps better adapted to <unk>
In this huge symphony of the universe, the life in Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal animal is like a only <unk> the animal animal and human life, a little bit of crime.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> of this talk that I hope that they have <unk>
When I was just <unk> I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by <unk> and beauty of biology.
I fell on the power of evolution and I realized about the existence of life, in organisms -- in the <unk> organisms every cell is just <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is actually spending the two cells.
But when you look at these organisms <unk> things start to change.
He goes on the sex <unk>
And something very important with the emergence of sexual <unk> which is the rest of the body, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the death of the body of the body of the body comes in evolution in the same time of sexual emotions.
I have to <unk> that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> <unk> death for <unk> it was pretty reasonable in that time, but it was every year that I used every year I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the 90 years.
And one night somebody goes back to her door <unk>
He opens the door.
In the one of it is a little <unk> <unk>
And it look at it, and he says, <unk> in looking for a <unk> <unk>
I mean, it says, "You say, "I remember <unk>
And I realized that as a doctor, I was working for a different goal, the goal of the <unk> don't necessarily <unk>
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to make us a quick <unk>
I wanted to get health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more <unk>
The evolution is going to spend the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From one point of interesting view you -- and we are kind of like <unk> <unk> designed to send the genetic <unk> to the next level and then you get to the sea.
I think that all of the <unk> the feeling that I said, <unk> <unk> when he said, "I want to get the way through my job.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
The evolution don't necessarily get to the <unk>
They don't necessarily take the greatest or the most fast or more fast or even more intelligent to the more smart or even more intelligent to the more smart or even more intelligent to the more smart or even more intelligent to the more smart or even more intelligent to the more smart or even more intelligent to the more smart or even more intelligent to the more smart or
The evolution are going to be the best food creatures to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean of the ocean is <unk> that you can survive into the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if I had fish there, and we have been there, and we have been able to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does it mean that when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go to think about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look at the <unk> <unk> I would say there are a lot of possibilities.
The first is that I don't have no <unk>
We've got a kind of balance.
And the proposal is, it would be that through medicine in the first place, we've been able to preserve a lot of genes that in the other way would be <unk> and <unk> of the population.
And second of all, as species, we have <unk> our environment for us to get us to us as as we give us to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we get them so much that it is not possible to have the values that we need to be able to have the values that the evolution.
A second possibility is that you have a second possibility is that you get a evolution of the natural class in the forces of nature.
And the argument here you want to know that the <unk> of the evolution they can get <unk> but they're <unk>
And in terms of the <unk> when as a kind of <unk> planets are going to be <unk> and the environmental changes that can produce the evolution of natural way.
But there is a third chance a <unk> possibility and <unk>
I call it <unk> the new business, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and <unk> for us as individuals in decisions that <unk>
Now, how could it happen to happen?
How could we get to do this?
First of you think about the reality that many people today, in some cultures are taking decisions about its <unk>
In some cultures are going to have more women.
It's not a good thing for society but it's what they choose to the individual and the family of the family is what they turn up to the individual and family of the life.
Think that if it would be possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make sex -- but in its own body to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic changes to take the <unk> or diseases or reduce the risk of breast cancer.
You don't want to make those changes in their own.
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Industrial War started in 1990, and he took 13 years.
<unk> billion dollars.
At the last year, in 2004, I could be done the same work for 20 million dollars in three million dollars in three million dollars in three million dollars in three -- four months.
Today, you can get a complete sequence of the three billion pairs of the world's the human genome to a cost of 20,000 and in a week.
It's not a lot of so that it makes the human genome for <unk> and will be getting more to all of all.
They come out those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make us that we don't only protect them from them but they're going to be able to protect them out of other virus.
<unk> or there is no international trial in course with the vaccine against <unk> <unk> in cells from a <unk>
You can imagine something good that comes from the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be more possible.
Imagine that only two two little <unk>
You can change the cells of their bodies but if you can change the cells of its <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or the <unk> or the <unk> or to change their children a better chance to a more <unk> life to take the morality to take the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who don't want children more <unk>
And then that same technology <unk> that same size of science that can produce changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to allow us to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
Why don't have the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> on all if you could <unk> with the next generation of the <unk>
Why don't have a <unk> muscle muscle that lets us turn more fast and more <unk>
Why don't you live more time.
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to go on this next generation and we can apply the attributes that we wanted to be able to be the evolution before the <unk>
So we're going to take a process that usually could take 100 years ago, and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to have to have to have to have them.
We are going to use these options in the middle of a better society, more <unk>
Or we're going to choose to choose to choose some different attributes that we want to have for some of us but not for the <unk>
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more <unk> and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we are going to have to help them.
And the most profound thing that we are going to be able to develop the wisdom and the wisdom that the wisdom needed to take these <unk> decisions.
For good or wrong, and before what I could <unk> these options are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're going to consider <unk> <unk>
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a balloon doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a only day that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only thing I could talk about the <unk>
So I said, and they said, "It's no problem. Probably a few <unk>
The pilot had been <unk> the airplane, and we were not so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
<unk> <unk> the airplane with the river of the <unk>
So that's not the road.
<unk> <unk>
Imagine being in a plane and without <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The three words <unk> that I have heard about.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about more with <unk>
I was able to see it in their eyes,
It was <unk> <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about my day.
I learned that all changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they were in life, and I thought about the whole people that I wanted to get and I did all the <unk> that I wanted to get and I did all the <unk> I wanted to get all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that more later, I came up a <unk> which is <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because if the came is ready and the person is there, I'm going to take it up there, I'm going to take it away.
I don't want to <unk> anything in life.
And that <unk> really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as <unk> the bridge George Washington, I was not a lot of -- I thought -- I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also gave my <unk>
And I'm going to talk about the time that you don't know in things that they don't understand with people who do.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends with people.
And after <unk> in that, I decided to take the negative power of my life.
It's not perfect but it's much better.
In two years I haven't had a fight with my wife.
You feel <unk>
I don't try to have <unk> <unk> being <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your own mental <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be used in 20 pieces like you see in those <unk>
And as I was <unk> I had the sense of <unk> die wasn't fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all our life.
But it was very popular.
I didn't want to love my life.
And that GDP is <unk> in a single thought, which is just wanting a thing.
I wish I could see my children to grow back.
A month later, I was in a family of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of <unk> <unk> --    And <unk> <unk> as a small child.
And for me, that was all the reason to be the world.
In that point I was able to connect those two tumors that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great father.
On all, the only goal I have in life is being a good father.
I had to give me a <unk> to die that day.
And they sent me another gift that was the possibility to look at the future and go back and live in another way.
You are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing is going on their plane -- and so it doesn't be so -- but you can be so -- but you know, and how do it <unk>
What do you think that they still expect to do because they think you're going to live for <unk>
How can you change their relations and energy energy in it.
And most importantly, they're being the best parents that <unk>
Thank you.
We've been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the greatest thing that I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk>
A day came to his house after <unk> and he said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today <unk> has a difference?
You can only use your eyes.
Your job made in me.
I have a design company and animation so that, obviously, is something <unk> and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and your cause.
So I went to me and I met with his brother and his father and I said, "Let's give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I want to be able to talk about Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he can be able to communicate
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> it's not that all the people with <unk> you can communicate by those <unk>
And he said, "No, at least that you have somebody important and you have a very good sure you can't actually do it.
And these devices are not accessible for people.
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate
Someone at seen the film, <unk> and <unk>
They communicate out of that way, they go back with the finger.
I said, "This is <unk> How can you be?
So I told me with the only desire to raise a <unk> and instead of that he wrote a realize that I didn't have the lower idea of how it was going to <unk>
I was <unk> with his brother and with her father there in that very long time, -- well, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk about a machine, and we're going to find a way to make their art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who have so much in their inside of their inside <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who have a technology that allows them to be a technology in any surface and then, with a <unk> <unk> what and the dark space of the dark space.
So you're going to go on there doing a art of art like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a cycle of life.
First of you start with the genetic organs after the bad words, after the <unk> and the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of an organization and a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of things.
One, they send the doors from the <unk> companies and we get a machine to <unk> it could be <unk> a machine like Dr. <unk>
What was cool.
And really, it's about the most <unk> I call it <unk> because I call the guy you get a email email from him, and you say, "It's <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing that we did was to bring up to seven programmers around the world <unk> from all the <unk> of all the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the <unk> and these hackers and programmers and <unk> they took the control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when you were <unk> they would have taken the walls from the walls and in their place would be <unk>
But for two weeks ago, we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my son -- my son was and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a couple of <unk> sun, which we buy in the <unk> <unk> and something of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
So we take a <unk> camera, the <unk> we went on about a <unk> light and now there is a device that is free -- -- we published the code -- we published the code <unk> the software goes up in the time.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no company that I say <unk>
There is no hospital that can tell you.
Any person with deforestation, today has access to draw and communicate using their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you for you that was impressive.
So at the end of the two weeks we went to the room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's the room.
There were all this <unk> and <unk> for the great <unk>
And after more than a year of <unk> two weeks of <unk> <unk> <unk> from all night, Tony became a first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the <unk> system of its life and it's looking through the system of the life.
And I put the bed so I could see.
And we put a little bit about a little wall on a wall of the hospital.
And he turned to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the <unk>
The funny thing was that we had to take it on the survey so we feel as if we were <unk> the distance as well.
At the end of this one, he sent us a email and this was what we said, "This was the first time I was in seven years.
I felt like if I had been under the water and somebody finally went to <unk> and I took me out of there to be able to <unk>
It's not <unk>
In some way that is our war.
That's what it comes on in movement, <unk>
And we have a long way to go with this.
It's a great device but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Someone with this common potential is a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to do it and make it faster and <unk>
So we've had all kinds of <unk>
We've got a lot of medicine.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is doing money with this.
All of our own bodies.
<unk> were <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
I said, <unk> something about us and then, in December, the World Center took us as one of the 50 <unk> and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what it comes to close the <unk> is that in July this year in the <unk> of this year in the middle of the Los Angeles is going to have an exhibition called <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have to have the best <unk> of the urban art <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all they are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible to do it as possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the computer, the computer, the <unk> the <unk> -- nothing was possible in some time.
You can look at any of this room.
I'm not a sudden, I never did anything with <unk> technology technology -- I just found something -- and I'm going to get a wonderful people to be able to be able to happen.
And these are the questions that I want to do all the days when we find it all the days when we find something that you have to do.
Thank you.
I've spent the last few years ago in situations usually very hard and at the same time a lot.
I went to <unk>
I worked on a <unk> <unk>
It was in <unk> areas and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating only -- a lot of the beginning, something hard in the beginning, something hard in the middle of a very dangerous time.
In fact, in the great part of my career, I have been <unk> in situations in the single goal, with the only goal to treat.
So when I knew that I was here to make a TEDTalk on the world of the <unk> and the <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you can have <unk> or no, a couple weeks ago, I got a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some in Twitter, they had a <unk> rights rights for the name of my head of 2011.
And what there was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you don't have idea what it comes to it, and the content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it into ridiculous to you, or your company to do it.
But I said this is a very good opportunity to <unk>
Do you know how much people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by true.
So even with that <unk> knew that somebody was going to buy the rights for the name.
If I had it asked me a year I had no <unk>
But in the new film I am working on, we looked at the world of the <unk>
And as I said before, I've been interested in common situations in the last few years, but nothing I could <unk> nothing could <unk> for something so hard or so dangerous as you can go back into these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Josh <unk> I want to make a film that I think about the <unk> and the <unk> and that all the film is <unk> with <unk> and <unk>
The film is going to call the most big film, never <unk>
What happens in the greatest film, you never <unk> is that all of the top at the end of the end of the end of the <unk> it looks at the time from the <unk> that it comes up before the <unk> that comes up before the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And these people are going to get up to the left for forever.
And so the film shows all this idea. <unk> <unk> is what? It's <unk> It's <unk> <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> just <unk> It was more by <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But not only we're going to have the <unk> <unk> in the title of the title but we are going to make sure <unk> all the cases we can in the <unk>
Maybe it turns out a <unk> and it turns out the most cool thing that you have <unk>
The most great car that you have come on in the most big car that you have <unk> the best <unk> that you have <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> the idea is then to show you the <unk> as part of the life, they make it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and actually we show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the whole film is transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the whole idea all the <unk> of beginning to end.
And I would love to be able to help them to help them happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear it, is the best respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how a <unk> is going to be people to it.
<unk> you have a <unk> -- I don't know if you <unk> it is very <unk> but you know how it's going to <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money makes you need to do this?
MS: A million and a half million and a half of <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to the meeting with them but no doubt is going to convince them to convince a couple of big <unk>
<unk> you know, maybe for the moment that it comes to the film, we see it as a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think it's going to be the same.
<unk> <unk> Most of the responses will be <unk>
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> by the film or being saying.
About things.
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
And so I was <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: <unk> <unk> <unk>
MK: We have to think about what we could.
MS: Yeah. That is the <unk> when you look at people who you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where you go. <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought that <unk> the <unk> meant we have a conversation outside of it.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one of these companies all of a sudden, all of these companies came away.
No wanted to have nothing to do with this film.
I love me.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And it was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was that the product to so many people as possible as it was possible to make it as it could be possible.
In the world today is the intersection of new media and old means and the stage of the media means is not the idea to tell you with that new vehicle <unk> which is going to bring the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I guess.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> mistake and that mistake was this.
I actually didn't have no as error.
There was no mistake at all.
This would be okay.
But the problem was what this image.
You see, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that they got to be.
I like your way <unk> <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> from simulation or <unk> you really <unk> that it is because of the <unk> or access of information, about the <unk> of information, about the <unk> <unk> being the last line perhaps the greatest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president of the <unk> the <unk> even the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it actually really changes it.
But why is what? Well, the <unk> <unk>   as that kind of weird sound that still remains <unk>
It's <unk>    Like this weird way.
And it is also very popular.
What else is <unk>
<unk> a whole <unk> <unk>
That is very popular.
When I started talking about the companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want to <unk> <unk> story.
We want to take a story, but you know, <unk> <unk>
You see, when I was a kid and my father would go to me in some side -- and there is it looking at it as it used to <unk> -- you know, there's three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's a story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a company, I wanted to help me -- and that only because I knew John <unk> and Richard <unk> from many years I realized that I would have to go through my <unk> and I would go to the companies and go to companies -- I would have to take them to the <unk>
So what I started to see, suddenly you know, I started to get <unk> is that when you start to talk about the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make a big simple movies and others who make a small movies like my mine.
And my friends who do a large big films that they make a large large <unk> say that the reason their movies have both success is that you have both success is that they have.
And then my friends who make movies they say, "Well, how are you supposed to compete with these big <unk> movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk>
Every time I'm going to go out every time I put my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
In any time for a interview with somebody I can say you are good for this <unk>
You're <unk> you see a little bit wrong.
I want to help you be <unk>
Maybe you should be a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there is one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> will have their opportunity.
So we're going to have so much for somebody as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
That is the look at it.
I can answer their questions and give you a look at <unk>
<unk> <unk> We are a small place.
It would be <unk> to the kind of small movies that we are <unk> we're more good <unk>
So we don't have the budget that they have other <unk>
So you do things like that, you know, <unk> <unk> people is the reason that this is why we are going to do.
MS: What are you used to describe <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: <unk>
MS: <unk> is not the way you want to describe something that you get on the <unk>
Man: We talked about something <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually put up to this hole in positive versus <unk> and <unk>
It keeps you.
How do you get a lot more time with better <unk> three times more <unk>
Things like those who are <unk>
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What is a common kind of common.
I need to talk to the man from the street, people like me to <unk>
They have to talk about my mother."
MS: How do you define you your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like their good hand.
Woman: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> at least that it's <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk> <unk>
<unk> something just <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the guy that I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the colors -- a lot of ingredients and things like that.
The general thing I have been able to take it up as a sun, or I like the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand that I am, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Brian 2: In part of <unk> in part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I am the kind of <unk>
<unk> <unk> in the country and the world.
So I guess that's my <unk>
In my small slide that is my <unk>
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because <unk> <unk>
Man <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's that something?
<unk> I'm <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a <unk> but I often put me on the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed a <unk>
I need somebody who could go on my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> <unk>
They helped them companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality <unk>
If they were able to do it for them, you can never do it for me.
<unk> <unk> <unk> right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family picture.
You get a little bit how it feels about your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people understand my way to see the world.
You need to tell you that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in the world that <unk> as people who do you, your friends, your family, your family, the way you live your life, the work that you live your life, the work that you do.
All of those things are <unk> and they start in a place and in my case, and you start in my family in West in West in the West in the West in West <unk>
You know, what is the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: <unk> is the best day of my life."
You know, how do you think about this with your feelings feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like the different things.
I like the big things, I like the profound things.
You know, <unk> <unk> so what does we do that?
What is the <unk>
Why is important <unk> What is the <unk>
He got a little bit about that.
A little bit about you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> you have <unk>
It has to be <unk> in what kind of <unk> you are, right?
MS: <unk> <unk> No, much.
<unk> Thank you for your <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Thank you very much.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There were a lot of worried about this.
<unk> -- the first thing I saw was this idea that there is this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your neighborhood of <unk> the <unk> <unk> is a <unk>
They are very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think that a few companies just are <unk> in one of their strong points or in the other instead of focus in the other time.
A lot of companies tend -- and it is the nature of <unk> to avoid the things that are not <unk> by fear, these elements and you actually actually put it something positive to you, and it's nice to see that.
What other <unk> are that?
The first here is the <unk>
And you can see also here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> <unk> and <unk> those things that have been and come up, but a <unk> brand is something pretty powerful.
MS: <unk> What is your <unk>
If somebody tells you that you get your identity your identity -- your personality <unk>
You're a <unk> <unk> You're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or you're more good a <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like to be able to be good like the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or aspiration like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or you're more <unk> <unk>
You're aware of sophisticated as <unk>
Are you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Are you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> that they said, <unk> they didn't want to form part of this project.
They didn't want to have nothing to see with this film, mainly because they don't have control, they had control on the final product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we came to tell the story in this film, and we came to tell the story in this film of how to identify the <unk> where the brain is so much to identify the <unk> and the brain that we have so much to be able to be <unk>
We went to San <unk> where they have <unk> the church to the air.
In all the city for the last five years there is no <unk> there is no <unk> there's no <unk>
And we went to school, and we went to school, where companies are going to go into the schools with problems in the United States.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects that I've had the greatest answer or where I've had more success are those in the ones that I've been willing to be <unk>
And that's what they did these <unk>
<unk> to the <unk> <unk> and they said, and they said, maybe these states don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how it has it <unk>
Well, since the film, the film was inspired in the <unk> of <unk> let's take a look.
<unk> <unk> the film, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 25 million <unk> in the media for this <unk>
This is just a period of two weeks and half.
That's just in <unk> or no press, no TV.
The film, it still didn't be <unk>
It's still not in <unk>
It has not even died in other countries.
In the last day, this film has started to win around.
And it's not bad because almost all of the states that we talk about <unk> your customers is not being there.
I've always believed that if you can be <unk> if you take them into those risks there are opportunity.
I think that when you take people from that is <unk>
I think that when you go to their employees in the order to the risk of the <unk> to the whole company for <unk>
I feel that you have to happen to move is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to share people who don't have afraid of opportunities that can be <unk>
In the last way, you can think we have to give it to fear.
We have to put that bears in a cage.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And in the end, we have to join transparency.
Today, more than never a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk -- <unk> <unk> has been made by my good friends of <unk> who by <unk> they took the rights rights and <unk>
<unk> <unk> great data in great opportunities in the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, <unk> in the name of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a wonderful question.
In my pocket I have a sign to the name of the TED organization -- the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the idea behind the simple <unk> <unk> is really simple.
We don't want Iran to take the heart network.
Their greatest way to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> in <unk>
<unk> boxes that you see are the systems of control in real time.
If we were able to take these systems that control and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
<unk> boxes don't use software from <unk> are a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a effective virus to bring up in a computer computer, it used for a engineer to test this white box -- then we're going to be able to get it away.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk>
The <unk> goes into the white box -- <unk> <unk> and the nuclear program is <unk> <unk>
It's easy, right?
I want to tell you how we found this.
When we started doing about <unk> about six months, the purpose was completely C.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these boxes <unk> these food systems.
And that's called us the attention, and we started a experiment where our environment was <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
And so a very weird things.
<unk> <unk> as a rat in the lab that I didn't love our <unk> and I didn't want to eat.
I didn't have sense for me.
And then we start to experience with different <unk> <unk> I realized that, and I thought, This is a <unk>
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking looking at the dark box -- if you find a beautiful <unk> and even if the program that is trying to try it is actually working in that <unk>
If no, it doesn't do anything.
So that was called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because they <unk> "I don't know what's the <unk>
It might be, let's say for example, a plant of the U.S. energy or a chemistry in Germany.
You can be able to make it it soon.
And so we put up and <unk> the code and we found that I was <unk> in two <unk> <unk> a small and a big.
We also saw that they were very clear that they were very excited about people who obviously had all the information of it.
<unk> all of the dots that we can.
You probably even know how much <unk> the highway.
So you know it.
And if you have heard that the <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you the <unk> is very complex.
It's very much about what we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code <unk>
We're talking about about 15 billion of the code.
It seems quite a very old language.
I want to tell you how we could find sense of this code.
What we were looking at the beginning were called the system, because we know what they do.
And then we took it out of <unk> and structures of data and we try to <unk> with the real world, with potential goals in the real world.
We need theories about <unk> that we can go out or <unk>
To go to theories about <unk> we remember that it's definitely a <unk> <unk> it must be a white <unk> and it's never sitting in Iran, because it's where most of the brain has been <unk>
They don't find several thousands of goals in that area.
It is basically it down to the plant of nuclear energy, and the plant of <unk> <unk>
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and plants of energy between our <unk>
I call them and I went into a effort for <unk> their experience that we found in code and data.
And worked pretty well.
So we were able to go to the small <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that part of the <unk> in the <unk> that black object, you see.
If you look at the speed of this <unk> certainly you can actually <unk> and even make it <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the <unk> was to make it fast and <unk> in a obvious effort to go to the engineers in order to be able to solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for instance, the number of <unk> it is in that code, you can't be <unk>
I started studying literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every single <unk> has <unk> <unk>
That had sense, there was a coincidence.
And they put it better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called <unk>
And guess what do we find in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk>
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gives us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands.
And so I didn't have no <unk> wasn't like that.
The results have been talking about a bunch of weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to go back to start.
Even so we found that both of the <unk> the digital <unk> is going to a only and same goal, but from different <unk>
<unk> <unk> is taking a <unk> and doing the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> is <unk> with six <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> we are very excited that we have been the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We don't need to care that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
So here you show you some very interesting things that we had really been <unk>
There's the white box and you see the <unk>
What this thing is that this thing is <unk> the values of the sensors for example, the sensors of the sensors of the sensors and the sensors and the sensors is <unk> which is still going to happen for the <unk> with the false data of <unk>
And we think or no, these data <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's like in the <unk> movies where, during the <unk> the camera camera feeds from video <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> to the <unk> in the fourth one.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital issue.
We need a human care of the digital security where a human cycle could not act fast.
For example, in a plant of energy, when the great distribution of bears is going to be able to open it into a <unk>
Obviously this can't make it a human society.
And that's where we need visual systems.
And when they are <unk> then you can be really bad.
And the plant can do it.
And not the <unk> not the <unk> system <unk>
And so I am.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This <unk> is <unk>
It doesn't have nothing to see, space with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could be also, for example, in a plant of energy, or in a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have to be able to be able to <unk> this kind of <unk> this kind of <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You can also use the favorite technology of fields for <unk>
<unk> the more possible.
And if you look at that, with what <unk> is with a <unk> <unk>
That's the consequence we need to do.
Unfortunately, the greatest number for such <unk> is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are living with a huge number of goals.
We need to face the places and better that we start to stop now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has done public in many sides of the people that the <unk> is the main bacteria behind this.
What is your <unk>
<unk> <unk> I really want to hear this?
Yeah.
My opinion is that the <unk> is <unk> but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is <unk> <unk>
There is a little bit, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because the other way, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and make it a robot that you can take them and the other that you make users of the <unk> and they turn them back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not all different of something that you put in the morning, it gives you a great force that is going to become their speed, and they asked them for example, to make the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not just that -- you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go up with the universe and with other <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now in what we're working started to talk about the American soldier that in average, it must take on her back a <unk> <unk> and it is <unk> to make even more team.
Of course, this leads to some very important area -- <unk> in the next 30 percent of the soldiers -- with <unk> <unk>
We decided to see this challenge and create a <unk> that could help us solve the technology.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> <unk>
JA: With the <unk> <unk> I can take it 90 kilos for a lot of hours.
Their <unk> design allows you to put them in <unk> <unk> and <unk> movements with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it turns out my force and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We are ready, with our industrial <unk> to produce this <unk> this new <unk>
I mean, it's a reality.
And now you look at the look at the users of the <unk> <unk> about what I feel particularly worse.
There are <unk> millions of people that are looking at the world in the world.
As one percent of the world's population.
And this is a really really popular.
We talked about something that happens with fast people in the column that we start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- <unk> against 40 years -- <unk> against a wall and the chair it turns out to be its only choice.
And we also talk about the population that you get down to be quickly.
Your only choice, so many times -- for a brain brain or some of them -- is the chair of the jungle.
And this has been so over the last 500 years from their successful <unk> as I have to do."
So we decided to start to write a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using <unk> <unk> who did 19 years ago, he had a investment on the column -- <unk> and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years ago, until it now.
<unk> Thank you.
EB: <unk> is using our <unk> <unk>
It has a few sensors ...
It completely not <unk> in the <unk> that they send them into the computer into the computer, here in the back.
And there are also some famous that you give up to the motors in the <unk> and they do it and they do it on this <unk> <unk> and very natural.
AB: she had 24 years ago in the top of my life when a strange step on the air, <unk> it costs <unk>
In a fraction of second second, I lost all feeling and all the movement of the <unk>
Shortly time later, a doctor went to my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> you never get to <unk>
That happened ago.
And so he took me to the last bit of hope of my own.
<unk> technology since then, I has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs it it costs on the <unk> <unk> rocks and even starting on a hand.
But they haven't invented anything that lets me let me go to right now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk with you.
It's in our hands and we have all the potential here to change the life to human future -- not just of them, but to all of the users of the <unk> and all the users of <unk>
AB: Thank you.
I just come back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the <unk> and the women have sex to say, <unk> and the game is the order of <unk> where the fun is a serious thing.
And no, it's not the <unk> <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know their police.
So this is the world of the world's <unk>
The bonobos are, along with the glaciers -- their youngest <unk>
That means that we all share a common bit of a common kid that lived about six million years.
Now chimpanzees are known by its <unk>
But, unfortunately, we have actually done too much to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
But everybody show us the other side of the coin.
While the chimpanzees are <unk> by the big, big, <unk> society is about females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very obvious, where violence are still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the less <unk> of the great <unk>
They live in the lower of the forest <unk> and has been very hard to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> a <unk> land and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> the stage of a dollar conflict that has been engaged for decades, and caused almost so many deaths as the World War War has been able to be almost so many deaths like the World War
It's not wonder that this destruction is also going to become the survival of the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and the deforestation they make it not can fill up or a stadium with the bonobos who are in the world, and we are not sure we are not sure it.
However, in this land of violence and <unk> you can hear the <unk> <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know that as the apes <unk> the love, not the <unk> because they have sex <unk> <unk> and <unk> to test conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the <unk> is more than <unk> <unk>
The <unk> as the humans, I love to play throughout its life.
<unk> is not just a game game.
For us and for them the game is fundamental to establish <unk> and <unk> <unk>
You learn <unk> and learn the rules of the game.
The game goes through creativity and intelligence and it has to see with the generation of <unk> diversity of <unk> diversity of <unk> diversity of <unk> diversity of them.
And when you look at the TED game, you see the roots -- the same of the <unk> the <unk> and the human field.
And the game is the shrimp that we can.
I don't know how to play you -- but I want to show you a couple of a only <unk> <unk>
First of all, it's a <unk> game <unk> and I don't talk about oil.
Here we have a female and a young young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the basic origin of the <unk> <unk> it has <unk>
I just think that in this case he was like, right?
Yeah.
So the sex game is common as much in terms like humans.
And this video is really interesting because <unk> this video really is interesting because it shows the <unk> to bring out and the <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> the <unk> and the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> you can take a lot of ways some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where they were <unk>
And I want to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with water.
I think that as that, sometimes we were doing it, and we explore the limits of our worlds and <unk>
And it is that curious thing that we get to go back to it, and then the unexpected connections that we have are the real connections that we do are the real <unk>
And these are just small samples of understanding that are all about our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to bring up to a world every time more hard with creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key of these thoughts.
In other words, the game is our <unk>
To bring it with success to a world that changes have to play.
But let's look at the best our ability to be.
The game is not <unk>
It is <unk>
So we can know and humans -- it's not just <unk> and <unk>
When it seems to be the least going to work, you can be the moments in which it's the most <unk>
And so I said, <unk> <unk> this gift of evolution and play together as <unk> the creativity, and the <unk>
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a <unk> organization called <unk> <unk>
When I'm not going to be able to do the poverty, <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk>
And in our city, where the volunteers are known to a highly <unk> <unk> you have to get to the place of the region very soon to go in action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second <unk> in the site, so I had a pretty high chance to go.
But still there was a career to walk against the other volunteers to get to the captain and find what our task.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the <unk> that we had no one of the worst days of life.
And we were in the end of night, she was on the <unk> under a <unk> in <unk> <unk> while his house was in <unk>
The other citizens, I had just got before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --  I got the first until the captain and this was asked to be able to go back and send the dog from the house.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
So there was a lawyer or <unk> from money that, during the rest of their life, I would have to tell people who I went on in a <unk> building to save a <unk> just because I won me for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to make the house.
I need to <unk> <unk> <unk> and he took them to this woman a couple of <unk>
I did.
I was not exactly what I knew but <unk> I got the skull at the end of the <unk> in the end of the <unk> <unk> that that height of the <unk> and I turned up to the <unk> and I went into the main room in a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my little bit on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog in the main door in the <unk>
<unk> from the house of the house of the house of home where, as it was <unk> her <unk> got a lot more attention than my mine.
A few weeks later the office received a letter from the <unk> house for the young effort to be able to save their house.
The guy that she looked at all of the other was that somebody had had gotten even a couple of shoes.
And both in my honor in <unk> <unk> as in my honor as a <unk> <unk> I'm going to be able to go out of generosity and <unk> in a <unk> scale, but also of the <unk> <unk> and the courage to natural level.
And you know what I've got to.
All of it has their own.
So when I look at this room in this room to people who have been <unk> or they're going to be a lot of success levels of success to me like to remind you this: <unk>
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in life life.
If you have something to stop <unk>
It takes food in a <unk> <unk> a <unk> park a year.
They are <unk>
Not all the days we're going to have the opportunity to save the life of somebody but every day we're going to influence the life life.
So you go to the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Giussani: <unk>
Mark <unk> Thank you.
And this can seem to be, but I am a great bit of the <unk>
The first building building is <unk> in <unk> with a very simple idea and a very simple idea that we write out of it.
Very quickly, these became the more used in the world.
They have allowed us to build some more great things that us, as buildings or <unk> a <unk>
And then these blocks have become the moment of our time.
It's almost a hundred years later, in 1968, to <unk> it was this happened.
You call it <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> <unk> <unk> all the home.
It estimates that you have been more than 400 billion or 75 billion or 75 percent of the person in the planet.
There is no engineer to build beautiful buildings or home.
<unk> did it <unk>
<unk> just led to the <unk> <unk> the favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the ground, the next revolution was about <unk> the new kind of building <unk>
The transistor was a small unit that would take us from a <unk> world that would take us from a <unk> world around the world where it was a world where it was a whole day.
At the same like the <unk> <unk> it allows it to create a lot more greater more complex and more complex -- a <unk>
But there is a huge difference -- the transistor was just for an <unk>
I still don't know the <unk> that the building building of our time are <unk> so I decided to change it.
eight years ago, when I was in the Media century, I started exploring the idea of taking engineers to the hands of engineers and designers.
A few years ago, I started develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are <unk> every one with a specific mental
They are <unk> to be light, sound, and action.
And the best thing about everything is that they get together by <unk>
So you can't be able to be wrong.
<unk> have a kind of color.
The green is the Amazon -- the blue is the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> and the color of the red color is the <unk>
So you just have to get a blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make it <unk>
A blue with a green is making light.
We can put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a <unk> <unk> which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
<unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have a <unk>
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very painful.
Instead of having to <unk> to connect and <unk> <unk> we allow us to program using <unk> <unk>
To make it more fast or more worse, it is just going to take this button that makes people to be fast or more slow.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a <unk>
We want all of the interactions in the world that are going to be <unk> to be ready to use.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all must be <unk>
We've given the kids to see them to play with them.
And it has been an amazing experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the fire of all the days you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does it works a night or why the door of a elevator is <unk> <unk> or how a iPod responds to it.
We've also led to the design schools.
So for instance, the designers without experience they start play with <unk> as a material.
So here you can see, with a piece of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> --   A few weeks ago, we took it up to the designers from the middle of the <unk> School of Rhode  who don't have some experience there in engineering, just in <unk> wood and paper and we said, "You do something.
Here's an example of a project that have made a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> that has afraid of the darkness.
For these <unk> <unk> became another material, the computer became another material.
And we want to think this material is to all of all.
And that's why they <unk> it has the <unk>
You can visit the website and download all of the design of design and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of <unk> inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this is us.
And so again, and <unk>
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk about the previous discoveries there.
I work in the industry of the solar technology.
And my little company is going to take it up with the <unk>
<unk> collaboration with the <unk>
This is a small video of what we do.
<unk> <unk> a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can go better to the video to a side.
No.
This is not one.
All right.
The solar technology.
Oh, I mean, I was a long time.
Okay. Thank you very much.
A couple years ago, I put a chance to recruit the best designers and symmetries that you take a year and work in a environment that makes a year and work in a environment that has almost everything that are supposed to work on the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a few <unk> <unk>
It took some members every year and we put them to work with <unk>
Instead of <unk> the World Center will go to the <unk> world.
They took great <unk> worked with <unk>
Your task is to show the possibilities of technology today.
<unk> <unk>
At the age of the <unk>
So here it looks like if you look at a <unk> but what it really looks for is that somebody is going to be able to go on the snow because it knows that it's not very good to <unk> <unk> when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did you take to ask this way to take this way so <unk>
Last year in Boston had a <unk> team for <unk>
They were there in February and in that moment we would spend a long year.
And they realized that the city never came up these <unk>
But one of the members called England <unk> I noticed something else that the citizens are <unk> with <unk> <unk>
So he made it like any good occasion, I developed a app.
It's a nice app where you can take a <unk>
You can be <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, I put it <unk>
If you don't know it, somebody can be <unk>
I mean, it has a gene component here.
It is an effective app
Maybe it's the most small applications that last year.
But it makes something that no other technology.
And it extends it into the way.
A responsible group of the city of <unk> <unk> to see this app realized that I could say, not for the ice, but so the citizens are going to be <unk>
It's very important to work with these <unk> <unk> but people are <unk>
So they asked citizens that <unk>
And then Seattle decided to make them to make citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to do that people are <unk> to clean them out when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that <unk>
And this has been <unk> without <unk> and natural.
If you know a bit of technological technology knows that this is not going to happen.
The engineering of software takes a couple years ago.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two months and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best school school for their children.
And then we told us that they had done by the normal channels would have led to least two years and a half million dollars.
And that's not anything.
Now there is a project in the <unk> power of California that until the moment has a half billion dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every single level of government.
So a app that is a couple of days and it is <unk> it's a kind of <unk> <unk> to the institution of the government.
It creates the best of the best ways to work, not like business companies like many people thinks that it should be.
Not as a technological company but more as the same.
I mean, without <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to make the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of a <unk> institution but like a collective problem.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools to get together together with vaccines.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that you recognize with applications -- <unk> all the days in their own communities.
They didn't have given by the government.
You have a great frustration to that, but they don't get it on the <unk>
And this people knows something that we've lost to see.
And it is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that are going to make them <unk> the government is, in fact, in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because you can not be <unk>
Now a lot of people have been the government.
If you are one of those people, I'm going to ask it because the things are changing.
The policy didn't get <unk>
And since the government in the last <unk> of us, you remember that <unk> <unk> the way we think about the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that government was to choose people to be <unk>
Well, after two years I've got to the conclusion that the government is about all, about the government is about <unk>
This is the center of food and information.
It is the place that you see, the calls if you make it <unk> in America.
Scott <unk> this call.
<unk> <unk> in the base of the <unk>
I didn't found anything. They started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors from the house, put music very strong music and see if you were <unk>
And it worked.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a <unk>
It has a <unk> website called <unk> <unk>
They didn't get that app.
It was the work of very smart people from the United States of New <unk> <unk>
One day, this happened really, it comes to this <unk> <unk> in my button, I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it for <unk>
<unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was talking about person.
In <unk> <unk> all is the audience, so you all can see this.
In this case, I saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I put the place, I found the cube on the top behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk>
He took the <unk> I went home.
Good <unk> <unk>
Very simple.
This is pretty cool. It's the present of the digital and physical thing.
And it's also a great example of the government of the government to collaboration and a <unk>
But it's also a great example of government like platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the idea of platform.
I talk about a platform so that people are <unk> and help others.
So a citizen helped another but here the government had a terrible role.
Tell the two people.
And it could be connected with the food services, of being necessary but the neighbor is a better and more complex than the services.
When a power helps another, <unk> the communities.
If we call the control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
A important thing that we have to think about government is that it's not the same than policy.
A lot of people are <unk> but thinks you are the chance of the other.
What our ability to the government system is <unk>
How many times you've got to be a <unk> leader and sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government government our values and <unk> our needs but then we don't see changes.
That is because the government is like a huge ocean and politics is the <unk> <unk>
On the underneath it's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of <unk>
But it is that <unk> what it comes to that that is that we were that we built as something that we used in our <unk> that other thing, and in a consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is <unk>
If we want to be that this institution works we will have to do that it is <unk>
Because it's where the real work of government.
We have to share with the heart of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They have <unk>
It's a group of common citizens that have written a very detailed report of the <unk> pages in response to the end of the <unk> <unk> <unk> about the <unk> project.
That is not real, but it's <unk> <unk>
And so that we have been <unk> to the government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
There are to see the huge challenges that they will have to help them.
I really think that we will be going to be able to go without solve the institution that can act in the name of it.
We can't use government, we need to be more efficient
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the function of government so that it can be able to be able to be able to turn up to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act -- just there is that <unk> the systems of the right way.
The average age of our members is about 28 years that I am, I am a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that all of the face of who is going to <unk> everybody will go to you.
You can express their opinions in any way and they do it.
So when you face the problem of government doesn't matter how much to make you hear their voices.
They're using your hands.
They take hands to the work to program applications that make a better better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use hands to improve our communities.
It can be <unk> a <unk> you can take <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Of course, we always could have to choose these <unk> and many people do it.
But these applications are like a digital <unk> that we don't only are <unk> not just the government of government and we get services.
We are more than that, we're <unk>
And we're not going to fix the government until you don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask all of the people, when it comes from the important things that we have to do together, we all -- we are going to do together, we are going to be a crowd or also we will be a crowd or also we will be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent the most part of the time in the middle of the <unk> and in the death of death.
I've spent the most part of my life in communities and places where there are a lot of Jerusalem.
And I will be here in TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I noticed in this short time, is that TED has design.
And the things you say here you have impact around the world.
In particular, if something comes to TED, has a sense and a force that I didn't have to have another way.
I say this because I think the identity is <unk>
So here we've seen <unk>
And I think we have learned that the words of a teacher can have a long sense, but if you teach them with <unk> you can have a special.
A doctor can make good things -- <unk> if it's <unk> it can make a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power.
I actually didn't know this in the practice of the right, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family on a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was <unk> was <unk> I had power.
It was the last word in the whole discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was young people who had been black.
Their parents were born in slavery in England about <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and their experience with slavery <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was <unk> but I also was <unk>
When I was small and the <unk> she came to me and give me a good thing.
I was so strong that I barely could barely breathe, and then I was <unk>
One or two hours later, I went to <unk> and I said, "I still feel my <unk>
And if I said that no, I got a new and if I said I said yeah, yeah, I took me in peace.
I had this human quality that I did always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lower of 10.
In particular, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to take their time and your attention.
My man were running around every place.
I remember when I was eight -- nine years ago, I was born in the room and there were all my <unk>
My grandmother was the other side of the room and I looked at me.
I thought it was a game.
So I looked at it, and she was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 -- 20 minutes, she took me on the room, she took me from the hand and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I never do it.
He took me outside and he said, <unk> you will tell you something, but you can't say <unk>
I said, "Well, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> <unk> I said, <unk>
And then I looked at me, and he said, "I want to know that I have been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you can do what you can do it.
I never do it.
And then he said, "I want to take me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "I think I want to be <unk> is that you always want to be able to get your <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to know that you always have the <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
And then he said, "I think I want to be <unk> is that you always get the right -- even though the right is <unk>
I thought and I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
And then he finally said, "I think I want to be <unk> is that I never <unk>
I had nine years ago, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in the south of the south -- I have a small year and a small year and a small year.
When I was 14  seven, a day my brother came home with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and I don't know where the <unk> we took me to my sister and me and we went to the forest.
We just have to take them doing the <unk>
And he took a <unk> <unk> he gave my sister, she took me a little bit and sent me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You're okay. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> <unk> and you will always make the same than us.
I took something like your sister too.
I said, "No, I don't feel good good.
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What is you <unk> <unk>
I looked at you with the <unk> and <unk> "Oh, not being thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what you're going to do?"
He said, <unk> says all the grandchildren who are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'm going to tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this is <unk>
But I have 40 years and I can admit that I've never taken up or a drop of carbon.
I don't say this thinking is a <unk> I tell you for the power that has the identity.
When we create the right kind of identity -- we say things to the other people who really don't see it.
We can't get to do things that you don't have to do.
I think my grandmother used that all of their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been <unk> during the <unk>
My little bit of diseases died of diseases related to carbon.
And these were the things that we had <unk>
Now, I try to talk about our solar system.
This country is very different in what it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there was <unk>
Today, there is <unk>
In America, we have the biggest rate of the world.
So we have seven million people in creative people.
And this <unk> in my view, has changed our world.
In the poor communities or <unk> you find so much a lot of a lot of a lot of a little bit like these facts.
One of each three black in the 18 and 30 years is in prison or how much the 30 years.
In the United States of the entire country, the <unk> who was sitting in the country, <unk> Washington, Washington, from 50 percent of all of the color are in prison or how much of the <unk>
Our system is not just a little bit in front of the war, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a <unk> system that is a lot better if you're a rich system, which is a lot better if you're poor and <unk>
It's not <unk> but wealth that make the results.
And it seems to be very <unk>
The fear of fear and <unk> do you believe that these are not problems of us.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We are looking at in our work some very specific number.
In my state in the <unk> as in the other states, you get out of rights rights to always if you have a <unk>
Now the <unk> of the <unk> population has lost all the right of the <unk>
And if we put it back to the next 10 years to the level of the loss of power to be so fast as it was before it was before it was before the law of the right side.
We have this amazing silence.
I look at children.
Many of my customers are very young.
United States is the only country in the world where it opens in 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for kids, without a chance to get there.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
It takes people in the death of death.
This issue of death is interesting.
In a certain sense, you have <unk> to think that the end question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very serious question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There are another way of <unk> it is not about decide if people deserve to die by crimes of the <unk> crimes -- but if we get it to be able to be able to be able to come.
This is interesting.
<unk> death in the United States is defined by error.
From nine people <unk> has been a <unk> which is <unk> which is <unk> and <unk> of the death.
A <unk> rate <unk> a gay percent of each percent.
This is interesting.
In particular, they didn't want to be able to be able to be trained in the <unk> if every nine of nine than you would be <unk>
But there are some way we get out of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our properties.
It's not our flight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I talk about race and of this issue if we were going to be able to get around.
It's interesting that in my class with students about history -- I talk about <unk>
I'm going to talk about it, the time I started at the end of the <unk> and that it took to the World War
We don't know a lot of this.
But for the American Americans in this country, it was a <unk> <unk>
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
I was worried to be <unk>
<unk> threat was what they defined their lives.
Now there are the biggest people who are close to me, and they say, "Oh you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, <unk> you know, <unk> <unk> <unk> people who let to say that in our story we have to say that in our story we have to say that in our story we have to say in the first time with <unk> after <unk>
I ask you to say, "No, you know, I grew up with that."
The age was the age of religion -- he was obviously with the <unk> and decades, and decades, of <unk> and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic where we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've got to have done happened.
And all of the time you get about with others.
We were constantly created and conflict.
It costs us to talk about it, I think it's because we are not willing to be willing to be able to get it with a really good process.
In South Africa, people understood that I couldn't overcome the <unk> <unk> without a engagement with the truth and <unk>
In Rwanda, even before the <unk> had this <unk> but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany to take talks about death company.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers came after my presentation and he said, "You know it's good to listen to what they were <unk>
<unk> don't have been death in Germany.
<unk> we can never be able to get out there.
The room came on silence and a lady said, "It's no way that with our story, we can never take in the gay death of human beings.
It would be common that us, and <unk> and <unk> we could be able to take them out of the <unk>
<unk> about this.
How do we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people -- especially if they were in their most <unk>
We can't be <unk>
It would be <unk>
And yet, there's this <unk>
I think our identity is in danger.
If we actually don't care about these issues so hard things and wonderful things are, yet <unk>
We love innovation.
We love this technology.
We love it.
But all of those figures are <unk> by suffering, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both things.
We talked about the need to have more hope, more than the most effective challenges with the basic challenges of the life of the life of the life.
I think that that wants to say about more time thinking and talk about the poor, the <unk> which you never get to TED.
We think about them is, in some way, something that is within our be.
It's really true that we have to believe that we haven't seen it.
So we are, despite being so <unk> so connected with the creative thing.
So with innovation with innovation, and the development comes not just only of the immune ideas.
And these things come out of <unk> ideas also for the stress of the heart.
And this connection of the mind with the heart is what you get to look at not just in the brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and the difficult.
<unk> <unk> the big leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Europe and suffering the <unk> we had all kinds of things, but mainly what we needed was that we needed was hope, to the situation, a going to be in sites and be <unk>
Well, that effects for the spirit is almost in the heart of what I believe, that even in communities like TED must be <unk>
There is no <unk> related to technology and design that we allow us to be really humans if we don't know the <unk> attention to poverty, to the <unk> to the <unk>
Now I want to show you that these thoughts make a much more important identity that if we get these things.
We go to <unk>
I had the great parents, being a very young, a lot of to know <unk> <unk>
These women were used just to speak.
Tell me the lady <unk> I was called me to say, <unk> comes the lady <unk> we are going to bring them to speak.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "I know <unk> I know.
So she said, "Well, and what is you going to be going to be able to get it when you <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was and just <unk>
It was very <unk> so <unk>
And in one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, the painting was led to me, and he said, <unk> <unk> you know, it is that idea of justice justice <unk>
Tell them what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my attention.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question the <unk>
We try to help whom have been <unk> <unk>
We try to interact out the <unk> and discrimination in the production of justice justice in the justice of justice justice in the justice of justice justice in the justice of justice justice in the justice of justice justice in the energy of justice justice.
We tried to end up with the death of life, without freedom to make children.
We try to do something about the death company.
We tried to reduce the population in the world?"
We tried to end with the <unk> <unk>
I took all my best speech and the end of me, and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In that time, Dr. <unk> was <unk> I put it into the face and said, "It's why you have to be very but very <unk>
I think in reality, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find the way you can find the way that these problems, these problems, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I have been <unk> in things.
I've got to understand and believe that every one of us is better to the worst we have <unk>
I think that's true for all the world in the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a <unk> is not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if somebody takes something that you don't know, it's not that it's a <unk>
Except if somebody kills another, it's not that it's a <unk>
So I think there is a basic dignity in people who must be <unk> by law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and without sure in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's not it.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is the justice.
And finally, I think though it's very beautiful <unk> very beautiful <unk> we don't know about our technology, for our technology, for our technology, for our mental capacity or <unk>
At the end of the end of a society, not for the way of a society, not because of the way of the poor, and <unk> but for the way of the poor, the <unk> <unk>
Because it's in this context as we start to understand very profound issues about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make a lot very very well.
<unk> <unk>
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> of a important way.
I've been all about these kids who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients of 13 and 14 years ago, who have been <unk> so that they were going to be able to get them out of the <unk>
And I start thinking, how can be?
How can a judge to turn somebody in what's not it?
The judge is <unk> but I see a child.
A very late night was <unk> for God, if the judge can turn it into something that you don't have to be <unk>
Yes, <unk> the judge has a <unk>
You want to ask something about that.
As it was so later, I couldn't think of it, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a client of 14 years ago, a small poor, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for me to my black client of 14 years to be able to a white white <unk> of a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there there had a lot of <unk> in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line about how in this country there is no <unk> but all a lack of <unk>
The next morning I thought that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my <unk> I didn't just have <unk> but I had sent to the own.
It took a few months, I was already like that.
And eventually <unk> my God, I have to go to the <unk> for this case <unk>
I went to the car and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went in the car to the time.
I thought this would be very hard and <unk>
I finally went back from the car.
I was going to look at the <unk> when I found it with a black man was <unk> <unk>
When I looked at me and he looked at me and said, "Who is <unk>
I said, "I'm a <unk> he <unk> "It's <unk> I said I know.
So I went to me and <unk>
And I'm going to take me on the <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
And that is connected to my <unk> with my identity with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went to the <unk>
At the front of the hand, the judge was saw me.
And he said, "What?" You wrote this <unk> <unk>
I said, "I went to me, and we started home.
People started to get all <unk>
I was the one that had written these <unk>
They came out the <unk> <unk> <unk>
From soon, without knowing how, the room was full of people -- all of people -- because we talked about poverty, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye to be able to see the <unk> who was and <unk>
It would be on the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking for here and for there.
Finally, this old black, with <unk> <unk> I went on the room and I felt behind me, almost in the table of the <unk>
A 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
And for the <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> showed you <unk> because the <unk> had come on the room.
<unk> is <unk> about the old age.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> <unk>
And the old black was put up to me, I looked at me, and he looked at me, and he said, <unk> to this <unk> room to tell you this young thing to get their view in the goal with <unk>
I have been today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral genome of the universe is very big, but it opens up towards justice.
And that we can't be really human humans -- if we don't care about human rights and <unk>
What our survival is connected to the other.
What our visions of technology, design and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of all, those of the people who share this, I just want to tell you to keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, and see a quick desire to the audience, of this community to help your <unk>
Something that is not a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities about you.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this virus.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in the age of death, in the next five years.
And despite this, the <unk> of the cases of <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> of the <unk> don't take anything.
Here's a chance to change.
This <unk> is going to propose that you get out of these money to make the law, to security.
I think there is a very <unk> opportunity.
CA: There have been a huge drop in <unk> in the United States in the last three decades.
Some of the <unk> says that you have to see with the biggest rate of <unk>
What would you say that you think is that?
<unk> in reality, the rate of <unk> with violence has been relatively cheap.
The big growth in <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's for the wrong war against drugs.
It's why it comes to this dramatic increase in the population <unk>
And we asked us to convince you for the founders of <unk>
We have three legal causes to bring people to <unk> people to get people to <unk> the <unk> by small crimes against <unk> instead of doing that those resources to their victims.
I think we have to make more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our present philosophy about punishment doesn't do anything for anybody.
I think that is the weight that has to change.
CA: <unk> have been excited about <unk> today.
You're very popular.
Thank you very thank you have come to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> the threats for the death of the <unk>

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> This is just some of the age that I got in the last six months -- <unk> could be the last six days or the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the means that the media would be able to be <unk> news because our minds are going to pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our problem are getting a lot more data than the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing makes us care more that you see, the first letter of all of those data is a ancient fragment of the Internet, called <unk>
<unk> is our <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> and it turns out all the information looking for something in the environment that I could be able to be able to happen.
So from a <unk> of <unk> stories look at <unk>
That old saying of the <unk> "If you have blood, <unk> is very true.
And since all of the digital devices are giving us to give us a simple news -- the seven days of the week, 24 hours in the day, 24 hours in the day, 24 hours of the day, 24 hours to the day, it is not wonder that we are <unk>
I don't mean that people think the world is going to think of bad in worse.
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe it really happens is that we get <unk>
Maybe the enormous progress done in the last century of a series of forces is <unk> from how we have the potential to create a world in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good <unk> climate change, the source of species and <unk> and <unk> without doubt we have.
As humans are very good for <unk> the problems and the long we just just just just just with them.
<unk> then happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years ago, the average life has more than <unk> the average percent per capita per capita per capita <unk> has gone around the world.
<unk> mortality has gotten 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, and the cost of food and crimes has gone from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most compelling time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global distribution happened from 25 percent of 80 percent over 80 years.
We're really living a extraordinary time.
A lot of people <unk>
And we keep <unk> expectations every time.
In fact, we would take the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, a great part of the people who live under the line of poverty -- they have electricity, water, <unk> <unk> and cars.
The <unk> <unk> from the 19th century, the <unk> of the planet, the <unk> of the planet, you might have been hearing with such <unk>
It takes a lot of this is the technology and changing its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Ray showed that any tool that <unk> in technology from the information is <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the price of the price in a few of 12 to 24 months.
So the cell who have in your pocket is a million times more efficient, and more fast than a sample of the years.
Now look at this one.
It's the National Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this way.
First of all, the <unk> that is -- in good and bad time, in war and peace, in peace, and in the peace, in the peace, in the peace, in the peace, in the peace, in the peace, in the peace, in the peace, in the peace, in the peace, in the peace, in the peace, in the peace, in the peace, in the peace, in the peace, in the
It's the <unk> computers used to build computers more fast.
It doesn't make any of the great challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law to the left, it goes back down.
The growth rate of technology is in doing more fast time.
And in this curve, to <unk> <unk> is a series of incredibly powerful technologies with the ones that we think about.
The computing in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call <unk> <unk> sensors and the <unk> the 3D printing and its <unk> and its global biology -- the government and the <unk> biology and food, social medicine and the <unk> medicine and the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the <unk> in <unk> <unk>
It was <unk>
I went in the middle of the <unk> the best <unk>
And I love this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
It is not a easy.
It takes with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all in the cell phone.
Four years ago, here in TED, Ray Jones and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our <unk> and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them that they had a company, or a product or a product or a product that can affect them the lives of billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can happen the life of a billion people.
30 years ago, that would be <unk>
Today we can point a <unk> of companies that have done it.
When I think about creating <unk> it doesn't mean to create life <unk> for each of the <unk> it is to create a life as possible.
It's about to take that that is <unk> and <unk>
You see, <unk> is <unk> and technology is a force that it looks like.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of <unk> <unk> from the <unk>
He is the kind of the left.
<unk> <unk>
The <unk> troops had been <unk> and the same <unk> with <unk>
But the king of <unk> came up with covered with <unk>
You see, the movie was the most valuable metal of the level, it was just more than <unk> and <unk>
That's why the tip of the <unk> to Washington is <unk>
You can see, even though the movie is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as <unk>
You know, it is raped by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and made the <unk> something that we use it as if it was <unk>
<unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a planet <unk> for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 percent of energy every <unk>
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of the solar energy in India is 50 percent than the <unk> for <unk> <unk> versus 17 <unk>
The cost of solar energy took 50 last year.
Last month, the MIT published a study that shows that the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, the electricity cost six cents the <unk> by hour compared to the 15 cents in the national half.
And if we have a lot of energy we also have access of water.
Let's talk about the wars for water.
Remember that when I got a <unk> <unk> the space came into the Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
<unk> a picture <unk> How do it <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live in a planet of water.
We live in a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is the water -- and the <unk> is ice, and <unk> by the <unk> of the world, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology available in 10 -- 20 years ago, but right now.
It comes <unk> <unk>
In a conversation with 7,000 Park, this morning, one of the innovators of the <unk> I'd like to share with you, I gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> is the <unk> is the size of a small hair.
It is able to generate a thousand gallons of water water at the day of any source of <unk> <unk> water -- a <unk> for less than two cents a <unk>
The president of Coca-Cola is just that I make a major test of hundreds of these units in the world.
If you go on, and I have a trust confidence where it would be, <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> innovation for this technology that is this technology.
And we've seen it in the phones.
My God, we are going to get the 70 percent of the cell in the world in the world in developing for the end of it.
<unk> that song, <unk> has best global <unk> in the middle of Kenya that the president was 25 years ago.
And I'm going to tell you with a smart phone with Google, has access to more knowledge and information that the president is 15 years old.
It lives in a world of information and technological information that no one could have been <unk>
So you can take the things that you know, and we have take tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars <unk> video and hundreds of thousands of dollars <unk> and music, technology.
Maybe the best thing you get when the applications was going to take the applications in health.
Last month ago, I had the pleasure pleasure with the <unk> <unk> something called the Nobel X <unk> <unk>
We are going to think of the teams of the world for the world so that we get these technologies in a cell device with the <unk> and since it has <unk> they can be <unk> they can be <unk> they can be <unk>
To win it has to make the best <unk> that a medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the world in the developing world in which there are no doctors, where the <unk> <unk> is 25 percent of the health.
When this kind of <unk> a <unk> virus or DNA that we don't want to call the way of health and the first of all, we will help that happen to happen.
But this is the most force to produce a world.
I call it the billion <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
And we just spend the brand of seven million.
By the way, the best protection against the global explosion is giving the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people in there in <unk>
By 2030, spending about two billion to five billion people from the Internet.
Three billion minds never before you get to the global conversation there.
What would you want these people?
What would you <unk> What would you do?"
And instead of a economic manufacturing we will have the biggest source of history.
These people represent tens of billion dollars a global economy.
And <unk> of more health because of the <unk> of a better education with the <unk> King and because the use of the limit in 3D and computing in the cloud will be more productive than never before.
What can we take us about three billion members of humanity, and <unk> and <unk>
What about a few voices never before it was never before.
What if we give them to the <unk> where you get to the <unk> where you are, a voice to be <unk> and power for the first <unk>
What do you do about these three <unk>
And if they are trying to get <unk>
Something that I learned with the Nobel Prize is that teams would be able to be able to be able to make things <unk> things that they can only do the big companies and they can only make the big markets and the cars.
I'm going to end to share a story that I really really got to me.
There are a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> in the University of Washington, in 2004.
It's a game where people can take a sequence sequence and find the way it was going to make the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and it goes.
It's a very important thing in research research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
They've started with this <unk> teachers between others.
And then hundreds of thousands of thousands of thousands of people are <unk> and they started <unk>
And it has been shown that today is the source of human patterns is better because the best things that the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the great challenges in the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have about three billion minds that are going to be able to work on the solution of great challenges and do what we had to do.
We have to have a few extraordinary years.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can say in a minute, before you give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe you think that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
It actually <unk>
And they used one of them as a very <unk>
It was <unk>
They did it a lot to the decade of <unk>
Now the fish is in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of time, on the bottom and other places, so that doesn't have nothing special.
But the case is that we still have to know the audience.
We still think they're <unk>
The <unk> they still say they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates the other <unk> <unk>
Because I was there in <unk> studying a <unk> in Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I took me a lot of with the sun, and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
<unk> was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, <unk>
There were <unk> from about 20 percent of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the rate of this <unk> was very expensive, and I was going on for a good time, so it became more than the average in Ghana.
When I was there 27 years after the amount of fish there was the amount of fish there was a half.
It was going to go back to the age of five degrees.
It takes a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In some way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the end of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
In the decade of <unk> <unk> started in the <unk> Europe has a lot of development.
The developing development would be able to discuss the countries that already had 100 <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this particular boat, was called the <unk> four.
I went back to him, and we had been released in the south of the South China <unk> and about all, in the Amazon Sea <unk>
What there we put was something <unk>
<unk> now yeah, the bottom of the sea.
The 90 percent of what we put was <unk> the other animals who are in the bottom.
And most of the fish are <unk> <unk> about about <unk> <unk> which are fish from coral virus.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the covered and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you make a study and then it starts the private <unk>
The bottom is going to be a solid bottom of coral coral in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk>
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were <unk>
Once we put a living one.
I was still <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This <unk> <unk> is what they put the <unk> every time you go to a area where you have never fish.
But it's not going to get it away.
<unk> the world but we don't know it.
<unk> the point of <unk> the new level, without remember what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
In the axis of the axis and we have things -- we have a lot of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water of water.
And that changes with the time, because people do things with <unk>
Every generation would use the images <unk> the beginning of its understanding of their understanding as the normal and it goes back down.
The difference is that they make the loss of the loss is that the loss is that that loss of loss is that the loss is that that loss is.
But they don't think the loss that happened before.
You can look at <unk>
And the end of the end of the end of <unk>
And that's that, in a big thing, it's what we want to do now.
We want to keep things that you don't don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when the societies are <unk> they kill animals without knowing what they have done to some generations later.
Because obviously, one animal is really <unk> before <unk> is a little bit <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lost animals.
Even if this is not like a great <unk>
At time, we focus on the big, big animals, and in a larger sea of big fish.
They get a little bit <unk> because the <unk>
With the time they have a few fish but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we take this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And it will be going to do it because the evidence we made in a single way -- it's not the way they expect to have the evidence.
For instance, the anecdote that some <unk> as you take a lot of <unk> as a lot of fish in this area can't be used or therefore they don't use scientists in the <unk> because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in traditional societies.
In there the huge role that can be able to be able to make a global <unk>
Because with the United States, we actually really learned the past.
<unk> the past that people can't think because the point of it has been <unk> and it's extremely strong.
That's for the people that you can see a rich area and you can benefit from the vision that we choose what it allows them to take their point of <unk>
And what happens with the people who can't make it because they don't have access as the people from the verge of <unk>
I think there are the arts and the movies may be able to fill the <unk>
This is a simulation of <unk>
It spent a long time there were whales in <unk> <unk> 500 years ago.
And you have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about what people were <unk> with the <unk> <unk> talk about the story of <unk> why do it <unk>
Because it was something that, in some sense, it has been saved
So my <unk> the only thing that you want to be able to do is <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
Hi. I am Kevin <unk> the manager of <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in a daily way.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos do and what importance has to do that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when I was more young, that seemed something very, very hard.
But today, the website makes any of us, or of our <unk> you have <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be famous in the Internet in a <unk>
You go over over 48 hours of video at YouTube for minute.
And of these only a little percentage is going to be able to be able to get a lot of <unk> and it has a lot of <unk>
How is that?
Three things: <unk> <unk> communities and <unk>
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
My God!
<unk>
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video back outside of his house on the National Street of <unk>
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> in the price of the past last time.
<unk> I don't want to make a <unk>
I just wanted to share a <unk> <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened on here?
It was James <unk>
LT: <unk> published this <unk> that <unk> the video to the <unk>
The descendants of trends like <unk> <unk> we find all new things and interesting and the <unk> to a wider audience.
<unk> <unk>  It's <unk> <unk> you know, you have to start the <unk>    And you all want to take the end of the week, the end of the week.  
<unk> <unk> is one of the most popular videos in the year.
They saw almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
At the same like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be taken from anything.
So what happened in the day?
Well, it was <unk> it's true.
And if you ask them for those other <unk> they're also <unk>
But what happened this day, this day, this day, this day, this day, this day, this day in <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many galaxies started to write about it.
Michael <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was one of the first people in doing a joke on the video in Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of <unk> <unk> a point of view and they share with a more <unk> the process.
So, this community of people who think this big joke is then it starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10 <unk> <unk>
As only in the first seven days, there was a role for each of the other days.
Unlike entertainment <unk> of the 20th century, this is our way to be part of the phenomenon <unk> or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> animation with a <unk> music.
It's that, that's it.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that that is weird you know that there's a version of three hours that has seen four million times.
Until the fields saw this video.
And there are the fields that they saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that turned out between the community <unk>
There was <unk>
Someone did a version of the age.
And then they made international <unk>
All of a sudden, it took all a <unk> community that made this kind of being a <unk> joke to something that we all can be <unk>
Because today is not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have been <unk>
Who could have been <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What would you mean you might have written that <unk>
In a world where you go on two days of video for minute, just the only and smart can be <unk> the way these things have made.
When a friend told me that I had to look at this great video of a guy that <unk> the <unk> in New York, I think I wasn't interested very interested too much.
Jack <unk> I was <unk> by the <unk> but often there are obstacles that they will be able to be a limited <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise and his favorite LG: <unk> <unk> I took to five million you saw and <unk> his idea.
So this is worth for everything new than we do in creative way.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The descendants of <unk> communities from communication, the entirely <unk> are the characteristics of a new kind of behavior in a new culture, where we all have access and is the audience that we all have access the <unk>
As I said before, one of the world's <unk> of the world, <unk> <unk> began in YouTube.
They didn't get permission to express their ideas.
Now we all are a little bit of our culture of <unk>
These are not the number of the old features -- it's only the media of the media -- but it turns out the safety of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a <unk> which is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the <unk>
Imagine the first <unk> a man produced the work of all a life.
It's a <unk> a <unk> a man whose entire life had been involved in hope of the only unit and freedom of its country.
<unk> while the <unk> come on <unk> <unk> the fact that its life had been entirely in <unk>
The words, so I feel <unk>
It is <unk> in silence.
<unk> <unk> for history.
He is my grandfather.
I never found it.
But our lives are much more than our <unk>
My grandmother never allowed me to forget their story.
My task was not going to leave that it has been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to be <unk> but <unk>
The next part of the <unk> is about a boat in the <unk> <unk> <unk> towards the sea.
My mother, <unk> I had so only 18 years ago when his father said, and a marriage and two little girls and two girls and two girls and two little girls and two girls and two girls and two girls and two girls and two girls and two girls and two girls and two girls and two girls and two girls and two girls and two girls and two girls
And for her, the life had been going to a <unk> task and a new life.
It was <unk> for she I couldn't do it.
And then from a <unk> of four years ago that it turns out with a boat -- a boat would put up into the sea sea of <unk>
All adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the <unk> and death.
As most of the adults, my mother had had a <unk>
If we were going to show you first you put my sister and I, and then she went and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the sun, the <unk> <unk> in each of the <unk> and the poorest and the United States and <unk>
I don't remember the hackers who came up several times, but they were <unk> with the <unk> of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to go for six hours.
But I know I remember the lights from the <unk> platform in front of the coast, and the young man who went to it, and I end the journey was too much for it, and the first apple that I didn't think about the men of the platform.
No apple had after the same one.
After three months in a field of <unk> <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of <unk> is about four women over the long of three generations giving a new different life.
We made us in <unk> a <unk> class whose population is <unk>
Unlike the <unk> of the <unk> class whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that they went from the <unk> they were the rest of the world.
And the age of English English was <unk> to the people who had a thing in situations they were starting again.
My mother was working on <unk> then in a single line of cars, working six days, <unk>
Even so I found time to study English and get a title in <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars they were <unk> and you have been <unk> and you know what it would be <unk> that usually it was <unk> that usually was their <unk> <unk>
Two pairs in the school, one for school, one of the holes of the other.
A high school until the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were very rare and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some of them <unk> and some <unk> <unk>
<unk>
Something in me is <unk>
I was <unk> <unk> and a voice who said, "I'm <unk>
My mother, my sister and I put them on the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we put it on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the boat.
And my task was going to be walking up until their <unk> can be <unk>
She opened a <unk> and he studied it to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women came with their stories about men that they couldn't make the <unk> <unk> and <unk> and kids who were involved in the <unk> of two worlds.
It was <unk> and <unk>
And they created it around.
I lived in languages.
In one, it was the <unk> <unk> <unk> with what it was <unk>
In the other, I was <unk> in the other, I was <unk> <unk> <unk> for violence, to the violence of drugs and <unk>
But many of them got aid through years.
And for that work, when I studied my last year of <unk> I took the young percent of the year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the screen to the another, but their rules didn't be <unk>
As <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and social gas, invited to talk in sites that had never heard of it, and in houses whose existence she never had to have been able to have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to go back to the <unk> and the memory of life in a <unk> <unk> -- a mother and two daughters the day as it did for almost 20 years ago, <unk> about the day of each 20 years -- <unk> about the day of every one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom, I couldn't do it.
I reminded me that I had the same age that she had when we go on the boat.
He had never been an option.
<unk> told me -- you don't be what they didn't do it.
So I talked about <unk> <unk> and education and <unk> and <unk>
And the most amazing <unk> was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all of the lives of life, many of them doing what we were <unk> living in the border of the possible.
And although I ended my <unk> I realized that I couldn't stay in a <unk>
I had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's good to be a bunch of a <unk> a little bit on the scene -- and not only that it's something that you will be <unk> perhaps a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the <unk> of your <unk>
He gave the enough steps outside my room to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we do.
<unk> who didn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, a <unk> <unk> a <unk> mix and <unk>
So I was going to go my wish.
And it took a small group of people who <unk> "Don't <unk> was a challenge <unk>
For a year we had no <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant <unk>
<unk> until the night.
Most of our ideas were <unk> but some of all, and we open it on.
I took the decision to take the U.S.
And then a only journey.
My breath again.
Three months later I had <unk> and the <unk>
Before I show you to tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time in which the <unk> was the social selection, and the local <unk> was the person who was doing.
The life wasn't changed for centuries.
Your father died before she was born.
The mother came away.
<unk> became <unk> from a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of his husband, it took a <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause it is a lot more <unk> led when I guess.
You can't be able to be wrong.
I was in the <unk> in the fourth of a hotel room when she took one <unk> in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the <unk> and I saw it on the other side.
I knew that I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
LT: I went to a <unk> temple in <unk> and we sat around their <unk>
We've got stories and we made sure we were still with it.
And the night of the night of the night came and said that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to take your hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why your hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
Because you have taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
They don't have <unk>
If you have a nerve in our family, that cost through women.
Because of those who we were and how life is we can see that the men who have come to our lives that have come to our lives would be <unk>
<unk> would be <unk>
I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might mean that for right?
However, I'm afraid to the privilege of the right.
I can give you a <unk> in their lives, a lot of the <unk> and a lot of the <unk> and the vast <unk> that we don't call any of us.
I don't know.
But if I could give them and see it to be able to do it it would be?
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of the same is here here in the fourth or fifth age.
My story starts in <unk> about two years.
I was in the desert, under the sky -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were a couple of how nothing has been changed from the age of ancient <unk> "The <unk>
In those days, when we were the animals, we wanted to travel to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with <unk>
In that time when you get the great <unk> a <unk> <unk> I had to be able to take a <unk> and with a <unk> to the ground, it goes water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we came out was that the machine had got to magic.
And that was a lot of <unk>
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
And I got this idea of losing the ability to enjoy the ability to enjoy the ability to enjoy the camera, if I didn't have the camera, if I didn't have a camera, if I didn't get to my friends.
I felt that the technology had to allow them to be able to allow them to <unk>
As a girl my grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this piece of the 50 years was for my own <unk>
It became a <unk> door to a world full of images and <unk> in my imagination.
And I had the sense that the trees, the <unk> <unk> and the cameras will keep them to <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
And so I was going to take me to me, I took me to this technological world to see how we use it to create <unk> instead of <unk>
<unk> books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the bathroom, I saw a technical device able to connect to the origin of the world.
You can know how to take the book, we take the book,
Where we are.
They put the text with the image, the sound and they did.
<unk> is getting more <unk>
But why do we do that?
I'm going to be able to launch <unk> an interactive app for compassion.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each other.
And like,  He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I got a character on the book.
In several moments I got a <unk> -- the puzzle, knows where I live because of the GPS -- which comes to me.
My little girl are excited with all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean and I don't mean and <unk> but to that magic of memory, to those ideas that <unk>
For some reason, the fireflies in a jar always turned me away.
So now here, we have to be able to build the cursor to release the information?
And really, they make your way on what I saw the book.
Another idea that I was excited about a girl was that all a galaxy <unk> in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world turned up in a <unk> that I will go into this magical device within the <unk>
And this opens a map.
In the whole book of space has always been maps but have been common maps in it.
This is a map that <unk> <unk> and they kill them for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book is also <unk>
I'm going to go back.
Another really important thing to me is to create the local content and the time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of the <unk> and the <unk> but how many people were in India know their <unk> <unk> <unk>
And these poor <unk> have been engaged in the cameras of dimensions, in a old and <unk> book.
So we are bringing it into a little little bit of <unk>
And in a story that is a story that is the basic crisis.
And talking about the basic crisis, one of the problem of the last 10 years has been that the kids have been able to have been able to get the <unk> <unk>
But now with technology technology we can take our children to the natural world with its technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this one where you have to go out to the outside, you take the camera or <unk> and we collect pictures of different different objects.
I had a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason they don't do it.
So in order to bring this <unk> of the childhood there is that you get out and in a <unk> <unk> a picture and then <unk>
In the other membrane, you have to take a picture of a piece of <unk> and then it <unk>
From this way it creates a digital collection that then you can put in the Web.
A kid from London put a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid of India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been <unk>
Within the variations of the <unk> connection and technology and technology is many possibilities.
In the next book we got to have a interaction where you go on with the puzzle, and the video on the video and it really <unk> it sees a group of <unk> <unk> that looks about the plants in the house.
In a moment the screen is full of the screen.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
Let's go into a world where the forces of nature is <unk> with technology and the technology and technology is going to move up to the other.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We are going to move our children and we are going to get the natural world and that the natural world that I sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing is that we let to listen to patients.
And one of the things that we did in the University of <unk> was <unk> to a director of listening.
And not about a very scientist, she took a little coffee cup or you and he asked them to patients, family and <unk> What do you <unk>
"How can we be <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of all, or maybe not everybody, but most of the <unk> projects we were already going to get out of listening.
This is my <unk> It's something very simple.
It has a <unk> <unk>
All of the morning I was <unk>
And yeah, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put it the challenge to be <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I was going to write my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him too. And so he can see what my favorite problem is not at the same time in the same time in the same time that you need to be <unk> or some effect of that that, but it looks like.
But there's another thing.
As some of you you know, I have more than four <unk> in Twitter.
So every morning I took me to my <unk> <unk> and before I get to my car, people start <unk> <unk> today I think you need a <unk>
That's the best thing that you can do, because it's the pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also that the patients let the patients let them leave it again.
On the other side, you can be <unk> to move people from their drug and together to develop some activity that we have more control of their health.
From the week of the week of the week will be available today.
This little <unk> connected to a iPhone or another device.
And people were <unk> from their homes, take their pressure <unk> <unk> to their doctor, and share with each other, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where the patients took a <unk> they go into the control and to be <unk> from their own <unk> but also you can help care about health because the challenges that we face as the <unk> costs the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> techniques that are a lot of used and start with this for the patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share with you with you with you with a video.
We all have <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
And so even we have to have in our hands.
We know it perfectly where they are <unk> in <unk>
What are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find <unk> food food.
But where is the most close to help this <unk>
We asked it, but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> play lives in this time.
What we did was doing was doing <unk> in the United Nations
We created a Web, and we asked the audience -- and we asked the audience -- you see a <unk> please <unk> <unk> <unk> and when it is open because sometimes open in the office and other people are closed.
And more than 10 <unk> were used in the Netherlands <unk>
The next step was looking for the app for that.
And we did a app for the iPad.
We created a app for <unk> reality <unk> to find these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> you can use their iPhone, and the weeks to use their cell cell cell cell and to find the <unk> <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this this is not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we have <unk> to the global level.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so we help us to help us to get to work and act as a center for the <unk> of the <unk> around the world.
Every time they are <unk> and somebody <unk> can be a <unk> or somebody in front of you, you can look at it.
I also want to recognize companies in all the world that they could help us get out of these <unk>
You might be able to be <unk> or people from <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> is still in its place.
Please <unk> in this and not just improve our health, but take the control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk>
Or it's <unk> <unk>
Because of course, they're photographs that you can't take with their cameras.
My interest on the photograph was photographed with my first camera to 15 years.
And you take it with my high passion for the image but it was a little bit different because the camera was the process was in the <unk>
And when you take a photograph with a camera with a camera, the process when the <unk>
For me the photograph had more than you see with the right place in the right time.
I felt that anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to get the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building in a very <unk>
But it has a <unk>
And despite it, it keeps a <unk>
Or they look like <unk> <unk> and <unk> and the common goal to keep the <unk>
And when I say, I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want you to look like it seems to be made of some way.
<unk> where you will have to think about a moment to discover the <unk>
It has more to see with capture a idea that we can capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seems <unk>
They're the details or <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What is what it creates <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is the perspective.
But at the end is about our way to interpret the world and how you can think about a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about if it is realistic but what we think about is realistic.
So I think the <unk> are very simple.
I see it as a result of the reality that we took different pieces of the reality and we put them to create a choice.
I'll show you a simple example.
So here we have three different objects something that we all can use with the three-dimensional world.
But all of some way you can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if I was born.
But, at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
And so you get to the brain because the brain is not looking at the fact that it really doesn't have sense.
And I see the same process to combine the pictures.
It's really going to really combine different <unk>
And the things that they make a picture looks like <unk> I think they are those in the ones that we don't even make the things that come around in our daily life.
But when we combine pictures is very important <unk> because of another way you see wrong.
And so I'd like to say that there is three simple rules that will keep to get results away.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But you can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the other pictures must have the same kind of light.
And these two images will go with these <unk> were taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
I could think that this is the image of a landscape and the lower part is <unk>
But this image is completely made by photographs of different places.
In the personal life, I think it's more easy to create a place that look because you don't need to put the ideas that has in your head.
But it requires a lot of <unk>
And as I thought this idea in the winter knew that I had several months to <unk> to find the different trees for the pieces of the <unk>
For example, the fish was <unk> in a <unk>
<unk> are from a different environment.
The <unk> part was built in a <unk>
And yeah, even I did a red house at the top of the island so it seems more <unk>
So to make a realistic result I think it makes a lot of <unk>
You always start with a <unk> a idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very good <unk>
If you do a good work to take the pictures the result can be very beautiful and so far as well.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you showing you a slide about technology, very simple.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took out of a story.
I'm not interested in so much to show you the details -- but the natural thing.
It's about a analysis that we were doing about the power of the <unk> <unk> versus the power of the global networks.
The interesting thing about this is that this as a lot of other we tend to see, is a kind of straight line in scale.
In other words, every step here is a order of magnitude in the scale of <unk>
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> is something like this.
Here is a funny thing.
And that's what I'm just going to talk about.
Please turn the lights.
<unk> more intensity because write about paper.
Why do it <unk> <unk> <unk>
The answer is that if you put it into a normal diagram where I say, these are the years or some of the technology that I would want to <unk> the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like that.
It wasn't a lot.
But if you know, for example, some other technology, as a nation in a <unk> curve would be very complicated, we see a straight line.
But if it happens something like this, it gives a <unk> change.
If the technology of <unk> <unk> as fast as the <unk> last morning we could take a taxi and being in <unk> in 30 seconds.
But it's not going to be going to be going to be able to go up to that feet.
There is no common in the scientific development of a <unk> growth that every few years are covered from magnitude.
The question that I want to do is -- they look at these curves <unk> we see that they're not going to be not going to go on.
It's not possible to support this change as fast as it goes.
It takes one of two things.
Or it is going to turn it into a typical curve -- I know like this to something completely different or maybe do something like this.
That's all you can happen.
I'm thrilled for that I think maybe you can happen something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a <unk>
In this line we're in a transition of what it used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I try to ask, and I mean, what is that new way you know the world?
So what new is the world?
The transition seems very, very disappointed if we're sitting on it.
I remember that I remember the future happened in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what happens in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all that we see.
In other words, the future has gone year after year, over my life.
But I think you need to feel something is happening.
And that happens a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot to think about 30 or 50 years because all being so different that we are doing today has no sense.
So I want to talk to you about how you might be, how could you be that transition that <unk>
But to do that you will have to talk about a little bit that you don't have a lot of things that you don't have a lot to see with technology.
Because I think the only way to understand is taking distance and look at the time.
The scale of time I would like to do is the time of life in Earth.
I think this picture has sense if we look at each billion years.
So we go back about a few billion years ago when the Earth was a great <unk> and a lot of chemicals that <unk> around you.
If you look at the way that we were organized these chemicals we give us a idea of how the things.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin with <unk> I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and that's that, in that time, there was a lot of oil in oil with all kinds of visual recipes in their own.
Some of those strands of oil has a combination of chemicals that they made them to take materials from the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the <unk>
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the different cell cell and more <unk> those <unk> of oil.
But those folds were not thrilled in the physical sense, because every one of them had a huge recipe recipe of carbon.
And every time you were <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, it turns out that you can be able to be <unk> being better to the hour of taking the chemicals -- <unk> <unk> more chemicals and <unk>
They lived over time, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, life, very simple, but the things are going to be interesting when these <unk> learned the trick of the <unk>
In some way we don't really really understand very good these <unk> learned that we learned that information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special brain called DNA.
In other words, I was <unk> in this evolution without sense, a <unk> system that allowed them to be able to be <unk>
The amazing thing is that that <unk> system seems to have been involved since it has a billion years ago.
Our passions our genes, you have exactly the same code, that same system system.
In fact, each of being living is <unk> with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did only for <unk> now we can write things with this code.
So here I have 100 <unk> from dust that I try to hide people from the <unk>
But <unk> I took this <unk> the code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this clip of DNA and <unk> 10 to half times.
So if somebody wants somebody wants to 100 million copies of my personal card I have a lot for all the <unk> in fact, for every person of the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it into a virus and it would be able to the room.
What was the next <unk>
<unk> DNA was a interesting again.
This made these cells are happy.
But then it happened another big step on the things that things are <unk> very different and it was that these cells started to help and communicate information to be able to fight information in cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can understand DNA.
And so for example, that we have to have been resistance to the <unk>
Some bacteria found the way to avoid <unk> and the <unk> to create its small DNA with other bacteria and now there are a lot of resistant to alcohol because the bacteria are going on.
This communication realized that they would be able to get communities that, in a sense, they were together in which a sense, they were together in which you were together, and a <unk>
From that way <unk> or <unk> together, or that if a community was very successful all the individuals from that community is <unk> and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the point of <unk> happened when these communities were married so that in fact, they were working up, and they decided to write all the recipe of the community in a DNA chain in the DNA.
The next stage stage for life took another billion years.
And in that stage, we have <unk> communities in many kinds of different cells working together as a single organism just working together.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that already don't act their own.
The cell of the skin is not about the heart of the heart, or the <unk> or the <unk> or the brain or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and created more interesting and created more interesting than the cell that we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
Those started <unk>
And to build very special structures that they didn't make more than design information in community.
They're <unk>
The neurons are the tools that you know the information that those communities that are that those communities that those communities are built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community to be the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them a real question.
Because in that moment as <unk> the learning was <unk> to the duration of a organism, and not at the period of time.
So a organism would look for example, to learn you not to eat some of the <unk> because I knew the last time you do.
That could happen for the life of a organism because before they had built these information structures of information that the evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years for the death of individuals who had that <unk>
So the fact that the fact that the <unk> system built these structures structures of information that are actually going to be completely radically <unk>
Because the evolution could now happen to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals found the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is the human language.
If we thought, it is a incredible invention of it.
I have a very complicated idea in the head.
I'm sitting here sitting -- a few <unk> about <unk> and <unk> building a big idea and <unk> in their heads that you find some analogy with mine.
But we took a very complicated thing that it goes on sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now lets us start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started making <unk>
Now we spend a lot of similar to the organisms -- <unk> <unk> our methods of <unk> and processing of information.
For example, the invention of language was a small step on that direction.
<unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> and they are the virtual mechanisms that we now actually build to make that information.
And that makes us make something much more big, more fast and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen to happen in all.
You see, you saw the basic <unk> of <unk> in which it created some evolution with the <unk> program in our eyes.
And now we have to take the scale over time again.
The first stages of the story I told you took a billion years ago.
The next story the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
<unk> language and it took less than a million years.
And the <unk> as it seems to take only about decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that your own rate of change.
The more fast the more fast you do.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the <unk>
We see that the process is <unk>
But I took me the life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that I work for <unk> it would not be possible without the basic systems.
But now design objects of the complexity that would be impossible for me to be impossible to me <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that kind of money.
There are thousands of million.
And instead of that, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think a <unk> level we put it into the machine and the machine with that it makes something that you don't want to get a lot more far and faster than never before.
In fact, sometimes it's <unk> that we don't even understand it.
A particularly interesting method I've been using <unk> is the evolution itself.
We put inside the machine a interesting process that happens on the scale of the time.
And for example, in the most popular cases we can have been created a program from a human sequence of instructions.
We say, <unk> please take a computer, you can take a hundred million amounts of instructions to you.
You could take these kinds of instructions to random, you can take all those material, and take those people that more <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I think what I want.
I mean, I want to know numbers, to put a simple example.
And so we found the programs that most of them are going to get numbers.
Of course, it's a little likely to have a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> -- so any of them did it.
But one, if you could put two numbers in the screen.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those strands that best made the <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> the rest of them.
And now you get the ones that the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Let's take two years that <unk> kids who <unk> <unk> and the children are going to make them -- and the children are going to make the <unk>
So we got a new generation of design programs of the <unk> programs that had a little bit more than success.
And we say, "Why is the <unk>
<unk> again.
<unk> a few thoughts.
And it tries to new and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few degrees.
So I can do the equivalent to millions of the evolution in a few minutes or in cases in a few minutes.
At the end of the end, we ended up with programs that are very perfect numbers of the very perfect way.
In fact, they're a lot more efficient that I could have written to hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to take them to see how they work.
They are programs <unk>
But they would get the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that you can make the goal because they come from a hundred hundred percent of thousands of programs that we did it.
In fact, their lives are going to do it.
Once I was in a pencil with <unk> <unk> and you take a card and he says, "Oh, this.
He says, <unk> a plane has hundreds of thousands of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> <unk> you don't make you feel <unk>
We know that the processes of engineering doesn't work very well when they were going on.
And so we started depend on computers to make public design work.
And that allows us to produce a lot more complex things that produces the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the whole options that there is.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
And now we use these programs to make computers much more fast and can be able to take these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing is getting faster and so I think it seems so well.
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we are in a long time to <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are the same.
We are in the same time.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very <unk> of our part that we are the end product of evolution.
And I think we all all of us are part of the creation of what it is that they do.
But now it comes to the <unk> and I think to stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've got it enough enough to allow me to give you part of my favorite <unk>
Before the subject of my talk, let's talk a little bit of <unk>
Why right?
We're about the end of the end of the end of the <unk>
We love it, right?
<unk> is full of quantum statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to get <unk> the <unk> talks about the statistics and we use them to form a huge team team.
I will focus on one of them and I hope that many of you the know.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about <unk> of a <unk> that <unk>
That means the <unk> <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball to the game field without being <unk> and that anyone who are going to get out of <unk> to the first bottom, and the second basis will be <unk>
Two attempts from 10.
You know how to call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how to call a <unk> <unk>
By the way, that is somebody than 10 percent of <unk>
<unk> like the <unk> Ted showed the last player of the 19th century, <unk> in order to take more 400 <unk> in a <unk>
And now you know, this to my world of medicine where I feel a lot more <unk> or maybe less freedom, after what you tell you today.
Imagine that they have <unk> and they're known to a surgeon that has also a rate of 400 in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place and a being wanted to have two <unk> <unk> <unk> and his family member of family is going to be <unk> which is <unk>
But you know something?
She is a lot of this year.
And their talks have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask,
What do you think that you think that is the average of you can be the average <unk> or <unk> from a <unk> or a <unk>
You know, so well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in the whole medicine knows the wave of a good array of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is <unk> in the world, and I'm going to be excited to be <unk>
And what you can find a mistake and <unk> to figure out how to do it.
That was the message that I was going on, when I was in the school of medicine.
I was a <unk> student,
One time, a day in high school, he said to Brian <unk> I studied until for a <unk>
Maybe it does.
<unk> in my small <unk> in the house of the nurses of the late Center -- not far from here.
And I learned about memory.
From my favorite class -- <unk> the origin and the work is going to take the <unk> of every <unk> which comes from the <unk> and <unk> <unk> and the <unk>
And even I knew the <unk> <unk> about how to interpret the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more <unk> more and more knowledge.
And I was very excited about <unk>
And <unk> from the medicine of medicine with the impression that if you were all of all, or the most possible -- and the more possible -- you know, you know, and the more possible to do it, because this is how much the mistakes.
And worked for a time, until I met the lady <unk>
I was <unk> in a university hospital here, when they brought to the lady <unk> in the space of the space where I did.
At that time I was going to put up with <unk>
And when I was able to go to a desk, I was going to go to that patient.
And to learn to the head of <unk>
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk>
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both -- which is a <unk> heart of the <unk>
In these conditions the heart leaves and instead of <unk> the blood towards the blood is going to bring up and the blood goes into blood, and so there is a difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it, and I put them to work in the treatment that I was <unk>
I gave them to <unk> and drugs to provide the pressure in his heart.
And I gave them <unk> <unk> <unk> so that I could take a huge <unk>
And in a hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I felt very well.
And there was when I took the first <unk> the sent to his house.
Actually, I did two mistakes more.
The sent to their house without talking with the head of <unk>
I didn't take the phone and I did what it should have in fact, I was going to call my head and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would be seen it would be able to provide information <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a <unk> which is <unk>
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take it <unk> that could take care of my patients without even connected to me.
The second mistake I did was worse.
At the end of his house, I didn't get attention to a voice in my inside which I said, <unk> is not a good idea.
In fact, I was so excited that until I asked the nurse to the <unk> <unk> <unk> which is good if it's going to their <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said and then he said with total <unk> "Yes, I think I'm going to be wrong.
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
And so it was that he was <unk> and <unk> along with the <unk> he took her home.
And I went to the room of the hospital.
The rest of that day, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach,
But I went to my job.
At the end of the day, <unk> to leave the hospital and walked back to the lab where I was my car to go home.
It happened for the middle of the way to home.
And there is the one of the one of the <unk> not the <unk> of the lady <unk> before, but another three words, those three words that most people were <unk>
Other specialists are <unk> but there is a <unk> in <unk> and it's that we see the <unk>
The three words are <unk>
<unk> <unk> the patient who sent their <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
Well, she would be <unk> with the same <unk>
She was okay.
But I went back and the verge of death.
At a hour of a time I had come back to his house, after I asked him the <unk> had a ball and his family was called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> and they brought them back to the <unk> pressure in <unk> which means a <unk>
I was just <unk> and I was blue.
The personal <unk> all their resources.
They gave them to bring the blood pressure.
And they put them an artificial <unk>
And I was <unk> and <unk> to the core <unk>
I had a wave of feelings because after the <unk> was a lot of free and I knew against all hope they were <unk>
And in the two or three days, the next few days was clearly that I never <unk>
He had a brain brain.
The family came away.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> what was happening.
And the fifth day, the left to go.
They say that you never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The few weeks ago, I was <unk> by that and she felt for the first time the <unk> shame that there is in our medical culture and I felt -- <unk> <unk> without feel that God is because you can't <unk> with your colleagues.
You do the <unk> and you never make that error.
It's that shame that leaves a <unk>
<unk> <unk> that I talk about is what makes us feel very bad for it.
It's what it tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that's that I am.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I am sure that you get the things and they knew that I didn't be <unk>
And I was born those questions.
Why didn't I asked my <unk> Why did I leave her home?
And in my worst <unk> why did I take an mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose that?
<unk> to a little bit of that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And in a day <unk> became opened the sky and eventually it took me to me, if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with with me in which if you get the efforts to be perfect to be perfect to be able to make the <unk>
And so he did.
I went to work.
But it turned to happen.
Two years later, it was increasing in the office department in a community hospital in the North hospital and I got to a age of 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he came up here.
I looked at her <unk> I was a little <unk>
I took them up and sent them to your house.
But as he went to the door I was born on your <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my <unk> change my head asked to talk about my office.
And he took the three words, you know, you know, you know, you know, it.
Remember the patient who saw the patient in the <unk>
So he came up and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a <unk> potentially <unk> called <unk>
You can see, in Google. It's a <unk> not from the <unk> but it is <unk> and that can cause the close of those go.
He luckily, luckily, I didn't understand.
They are going to show it antibiotics by the <unk> and it goes to the few days.
And I went on the same period of shame and <unk> and I went back to work, until it happened and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> didn't <unk> <unk>
And it is a great bit -- especially working in a hospital, because they were <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't love home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk>
<unk> a copy of <unk> but it turned normal. A colleague who was going to go up to the patient <unk> a certain guy who was going to have a little <unk> in the bottom right -- and I was called the <unk>
The other patient was a lot of diarrhea.
And I asked the <unk> to <unk> and I asked my colleague that <unk>
I put it up and at the notice a certain subject in the bottom floor, called the <unk>
They were both <unk> and it looks like that.
But every case, I was going to be <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most possible have been for the last five years.
<unk> <unk>
And here is the problem: if I can't go back and talk about my questions, if I can't find the <unk> I tell me what it really happens, how to share this with my <unk>
How do you show you this for the same <unk>
If I would go now to a place like this, I didn't have idea what you think about me.
When it was the last time that you heard somebody talking about 75 percent, after malaria.
Of course that in a <unk> <unk> talk about the mistakes of other doctors, but you don't hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues too, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the visual leg who would have to be able to look at the eyes.
This is the system we have.
The total of the total <unk>
It's the system where there are two <unk> the ones that they make mistakes and the ones that they don't can sleep and the ones that they have <unk> the ones who have <unk> results and the ones who have <unk> results.
And it is almost like a <unk> reaction as <unk> that you start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get out of medicine to the people who are <unk> we have a specific system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of <unk> and 300 years ago, I have made a personal study of bad <unk> medical and mistakes doctors to learn it as possible, from the first paper that I wrote for the first article that I wrote for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> white <unk>
And what I learned is that the mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where the mistakes happens all the days, in the hospital that one of every 10 drugs are <unk> in the hospital are <unk> or the system is not right in a system where the <unk> <unk> are every time more and more <unk> and <unk>
In this country, they die in the country, die by mistakes doctors <unk>
The U.S. Institute came up 100 dollars.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we are not <unk> the problem as we can.
And so they're things.
A <unk> system where the knowledge came up every two or three years ago, and we don't know us.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have an active <unk> that allow them to make a perfect side of a patient with pain in the <unk>
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in the chest comes to <unk> <unk> <unk> eyes and with <unk> and suddenly my story was <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They don't get their symptoms as much in the same way.
All of this, the mistakes are <unk>
So if we take the system as we <unk> and we had to take all the schools, likely to say, well, you don't have no nothing.
And that people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white white, <unk> <unk> <unk> is my worst <unk> I would tell you all of all, from the <unk> to the head of surgery <unk> "This is my worst <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And their students were <unk> <unk> <unk> your head and <unk> and they start to tell their stories.
They want to tell your stories, they want to get it.
<unk> to be able to say, "Look, you don't get the same <unk>
They need a context where we could do it.
They need a <unk> culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The international doctor is human, you know the human knows it <unk> and it doesn't be able to learn out of their questions, but it goes to learn out of what happened to teach others.
<unk> their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but of a way <unk> and to support them for all of them <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that causes human beings around the system, and when this is that happens to make computers in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I'm human <unk>
And I feel a lot of a effort to learn something that can convey others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with it.
And let me end with three words <unk> I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a second.
I made a survey over 2,000 people and the most average amount of choices that he says to choose a half American American are about 70 to the day.
It doesn't make a lot of research in the middle of a week to a research group of business.
The researchers took the different tasks <unk> by these executives and the time that we were able to make decisions connected with those technology.
They found that, in average, <unk> <unk> work.
Let's take a lot of a lot of <unk>
The half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Just an hour required a hour or over the time.
Now think about their election.
Do you know how many of you are going to the third of nine minutes, and how many of a <unk>
How do you look at the way that we get out of those circumstances.
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> choose to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When you do a question, as I do this as a little bit of your hand -- just if you want to <unk>
In another way, when you do a question, if you do a question, if your answer is positive for please give a <unk>
And now my first question of <unk> are ready to hear about the problem of the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
It took a <unk> student from the University of Stanford, <unk> this <unk> very <unk> at least in that time was very sophisticated age.
It's called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park <unk>
There was like 250 kinds of mammals and <unk> over 500 different different types of <unk> and <unk> and about 25 percent of water -- and this was when we took water water from <unk>
I love to go to that car, but in one occasion, I asked me why I could never buy it.
This is the <unk> <unk>
They had more than a different different class including the ones who were in the <unk> box that they were in the <unk>
Once I decided to visit the manager and I asked him, <unk> <unk> this strategy of giving all these <unk>
He tells me the <unk> <unk> <unk> who were all the days, usually with their cameras.
We decided to make a small experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>

They had a lot of different.
It was a <unk> for <unk> right at the entrance of the <unk>
We put there out of six <unk> from six <unk> or from 24 objects.
More people were asked when I had been <unk> a block that when there was only six, a <unk>
We also looked at us in what we were more likely to buy a <unk>
So here's the opposite.
And so I used when there was just the three three to buy <unk>
From the age of the time there was six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the <unk> the people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were recently, that if they found it away.
Well, decide to decide that we didn't buy <unk> you probably have <unk> <unk> it's probably a good thing to get the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the game of choices affects us in real decisions.
We decided to don't know that even when this doesn't be <unk>
Now the subject of the day is the dark saving
I'm going to give you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at the <unk> decisions for the age of about a million Americans from a million Americans from the whole country.
We were interested to see if the number of opportunities can actually see if the number of funding is available in order to <unk> the <unk> program people save for the future.
And we found that I really had a <unk>
We had <unk> <unk> that they were from two, until a different things.
We found that the biggest was the number of funding <unk> there were less connected.
So if we look at the <unk> we see that in the plans that give two <unk> the rate rate was about 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that you have a few 60 to the death rate to the <unk> rate in <unk>
It turns out that even if you listen to it, when you have more choice, even in that case, there is an content.
So so we decided that we decided to find the most was the number of the most people are <unk> by avoid the actions or the rights rights rights.
In terms of the most incentives they were more willing to invest in the financial <unk>
But any of these things are the ones that we are <unk> to take human well-being future.
In the past decade we've seen three negative consequences to get more and more possibilities.
The most likely is that <unk> the decision that the <unk> even when this is going to be in <unk>
It's more likely to take the worst jobs in the sky and health.
They are more likely to choose things less <unk> even though you're going to go better.
The main reason is that <unk> with looking at that variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for a lot of <unk> and choose of that amazing <unk>
Today, I want to be <unk> four techniques that we have gotten from a way or another, in different research, so that they can test in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You know, you have heard before, but it has never been more than today, which is never more than today, that less is more.
People are always excited when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're seeing every time is that if you choose to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the <unk> <unk> you have a better experience in the choice.
When you <unk> <unk> <unk> happened from 26 different different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> in 11, they saw a 10 percent in <unk>
When you do <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the products for <unk> <unk> which is less <unk> <unk> in <unk> for two <unk> and <unk>
You know that the <unk> of today, in average provide 45 products.
In a <unk> store it takes about 100 products.
But the greatest store in the present world is <unk> and it offers it just <unk> <unk> a kind of <unk>
In the world of the <unk> and I think you know, one of the best examples that have been talking about how to do better the options is the <unk> <unk>
And all of the employees of Harvard are <unk> automatically to a whole background of life.
And you really want to be able to give them 20 and give you 20 to not 300 or more.
You know that people often say, "I don't know like <unk>
All of them are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there are between those options.
And if your employees can't <unk> you can not make their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this guy -- I was <unk> with <unk>
He told me that would be willing to offer people from this audience -- a lot of <unk> with all the most beautiful side of the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want to be able to be.
I'm going to leave you about a few seconds to <unk> and then I want to give you a <unk> if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anybody who is ready to accept the <unk>
They're not else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew that there was a <unk>
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really thought to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you have more information in the first boxes that in the same neighborhood, but I can be <unk> and say that they thought the second time it was more real.
Because the images made it the most real.
This brings me to the second technique to create the problem of the <unk> <unk>
So people understand the differences to understand the differences of the choice, they have to understand the implications of every choice, and the consequences need to feel very much <unk>
Why is people spend 15 percent to 30 30 30 percent in average when it uses a lot of <unk> or concern that when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to make them more.
So we did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a team where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
That meeting, that <unk> exactly like <unk> we did a little <unk>
And what we found was that we were going to take up to the personal things that you think about the very positive things that <unk> in their lives if they were getting more money.
With this <unk> there was a increase in the <unk> of 20 20 percent of 20 20 percent of the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their <unk> <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can make more different than options.
For instance, this is a study that we did in a <unk>
We saw that in the <unk> <unk> at the end of the <unk> the exhibition of <unk> and the exhibition of paper, it can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the CRISPR tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and <unk>
If you think about the left is <unk> and the top of the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> Well, there's a few one.
If you think about the left is <unk> and the top of the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The left is <unk> and the top of the right is <unk> But you know something?
This kind of <unk> is completely useless.
<unk> need to be able to be able to get them to the <unk>
You can often see this problem with these huge <unk> of three.
You know, who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk>
It turns out that we can create a lot more information that we thought, if just the <unk> a little bit.
We have to increase the complexity of.
I'm going to show you a example of what I want to say.
Let's take a good decision <unk> the buy a car.
This is a professional car that lets it <unk> <unk>
You've got to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions covered in the number of options that gives each one.
<unk> color of the car.
<unk> box of <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is we can change the order in the order that you look at the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go out of a lot of international incentives -- <unk> <unk>
The other half of clients will go to a few animals, four <unk> <unk> <unk>
And what am I going to do it.
What do you live there.
If you look at you just the button for the <unk> in each other, this suggests that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones who are going to get in a lot of options to <unk> <unk> the button and over and again.
<unk> <unk>
If you go in a few options to many, they get there.
The same information, the same amount of options.
The only thing I did was changing the order in which you think about information.
If we started the easy, you learn <unk>
If you choose the choice of changes that you don't say anything about the problem of the <unk> <unk> of all ways we make us to choose to go.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
You can see.
I've been talking about four techniques to bring the problem from the <unk> problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can make more <unk> with less <unk> <unk>
All of these techniques that I've been used were designed to help them create the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own <unk> or for people who are going to work.
It's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is being <unk>
And the more hard we are going to be in our best choices we can make the art of them.
Thank you very much.
In the years. In the years, in the years, in the years.
I had to be able to get a little bit of example, written with the machine.
And this is so that the government can track the origin of <unk>
If they found a written with the wrong message you can track the <unk> to the origin of the idea.
In the West, we don't think that somebody could do this, what a lot of this is a lot that this is a lot that this is a lot that this is a lot that this is a lot that this is a lot that this is a lot that this is a lot that this is a lot that this is a lot that this is a lot that
We never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a copy of any <unk> printer of any <unk> <unk> and <unk> that page that page was going to end up with a whole pattern in every page that they are still a pattern that makes them to be on one of one and its printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems <unk> a lot of this.
This is an example of the ways that our government use technology in us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If you see what's happening in the world in the line of the line we can put the <unk> of their <unk>
There are three different groups.
They're <unk>
As Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the <unk> to win a lot of money, a little bit.
There are really many cases of <unk> in <unk> <unk> that <unk> money with their fish.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> etc., etc. etc.
And these guys do their <unk> in the line but they make it by the media that is <unk> by <unk> <unk> to prevent money from our bank when we buy it in <unk> or <unk> our future to get information from our <unk> when we buy it in a <unk> computer.
The secret service of America, the two months ago, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and this realized was <unk> million dollars when it was <unk>
Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I tell you that today is more likely that any of us is a <unk> that of a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is really wrong in worse.
In the future, most of the crimes are <unk>
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not used by money.
There are another thing that <unk> are going to tell you the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> as <unk> have been <unk> in the last 12 months ago, a paper role in the <unk>
Those are the three <unk> <unk> <unk> who do it for money, the <unk> as the <unk> that they do it for <unk> and the last group are the government that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That is a good example of heart attack, against their own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands, or actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
It takes the safety of the place and <unk> a <unk>
The week ago, I said, in a shop with <unk> government asked me to give you one of the leaders if <unk> the death of people to cause the <unk> to <unk>
And the answer of he was yes.
So how people are the people to cause a heart attack.
<unk> is a <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Why do you make the <unk>
Well, you need to be if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except, that <unk> a authority <unk>
And that <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> happened exactly that.
And what happened in the United States, and those things that have been done for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> <unk> the tail of the Chinese police came in July and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of <unk>
From those papers was this <unk> called <unk>
And within that, there were notes from a company with carbon in Germany that had sold the local government tools to bring up to a huge scale of the citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for <unk> <unk> the <unk> government.
The company is right here.
I mean, the Western government provide tools to the government and so they do this for their citizens.
But the Western government are also doing this themselves.
For example, in Germany, it makes only a couple weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the late government to investigate their own citizens.
If you are <unk> in a real case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But here's more there.
They are <unk> the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools.
When we think about the things like these the obvious response should be "Well, it seems a bad thing -- but I actually don't feel because I am a <unk>
Why do you do that?
I don't have nothing that <unk>
And that argument doesn't have sense.
It's in play.
<unk> is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy to security.
It's about food against control.
If we really might be able to trust our government today in 2011, any right that we would have today, it's for forever.
<unk> <unk> in any government government in a systems that we could have within 50 years?
And these are the questions that we need to think about the next 50 years.
Here is where I live in Kenya, in Kenya, in the South part of the South National Park
And these are the cows of my God, at the bottom, and behind the <unk> the National Park
The National Street of Nairobi has no <unk> in the highest part of the south, which means that animal animals like the <unk> <unk> was outside outside the audience.
And instead of the <unk> and this is what they do.
<unk> our slides.
This is one of the who they killed by night, and so soon we would take it on the morning and we found them very bad because it was the only <unk> that we have been the only <unk>
My community, we think that we came from the sky with our animals and all the land and all the land to <unk> and so the value so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of <unk>
<unk> are <unk> to protect our community and put them and also they're <unk> with the problem.
So they kill them.
This is one of the six lions who killed in home?
I think that for this is so few in the National Street of <unk>
A kid in my community, from the six to nine years is responsible for carbon from his father and this was the same thing I was going to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use that, because I thought the lions would be fear.
But I realized that it actually doesn't be <unk> because even the lions to see the <unk>
I don't get <unk>
A second idea was using a <unk>
I was all of asking the lions so that I was close to the <unk>
But the lions are very clever --  They got the first day and they saw the <unk> and the second day, and they said, but the second day, it is always here.  And so I said, and they killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the <unk> with a torch and that day the lions didn't go back.
I found that the lions are afraid of light that they are.
So I had a idea.
And I got a going to be able to go back and turn the lights.
And this is a little member of a <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar solar and the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the small box -- I call it a <unk>
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> you can see, because that's where they come out of the <unk>
And so it's how they look at it, when you look at the night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm going to be going to be walking on my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house about two years ago, and since then, we never went to have trouble with <unk>
And the houses you hear the idea.
One of them is this <unk>
she had killed a lot of animals were killed the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said I know.
<unk> you can see the bottom, these are the lights for them.
Since then, I've been sitting in seven houses in my community and they're going to be a lot of a lot.
And my idea is also used now for the whole Kenya, and the other risks like <unk> <unk> and it's also using them to be <unk> <unk>
Thank you this <unk> I had the <unk> to get a competition in one of the best schools in Kenya, and I am very excited.
My new school now is helping and <unk> and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and we studied the lights in the houses that they don't have and teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see the fly, and I said some day would be within one.
And here I am.
I started the opportunity to come on a plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is going to be a <unk> and a pilot when I was born.
I used to convince them to <unk> but now as my invention is saving cows from my dad and the <unk> we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> what in my language.
Chris Anderson: You don't see, the exciting thing that is to hear a story like it.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yeah.
CA: Are you working in other different thoughts.
What is the next thing in your slides.
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close to close CA:
<unk> I know that you already invented the <unk> <unk> but I want to do my mine.
CA: You know, it was <unk> a time, <unk> and <unk> <unk> I had tried before, but I got a <unk>  CA: The foot of the film,  CA:
We're going to get it into every step that <unk> friend of me.
Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up with a song called no <unk>
And I felt very happy.
In school, we took all the time studying the story of <unk> <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, North Korea are <unk>
Even though I asked me about the rest of the world, I thought I would happen to be all my life in North Korea, until it all changed it changed away.
When I had seven years ago, I saw my first public work.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I had never been born.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my colleague of my God!
And I said, "When you <unk> this, the five members of the family will be able to exist in this world, because we haven't got in the two weeks ago.
We are <unk> together in the floor, and our bodies are so expensive, we are ready to die."
I was very hot.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time, when I walked on front of the <unk> <unk> I saw something terrible that I can't remember my memory.
A woman was born in the street, he was built in the street, they had a <unk> kid in their arms looking at the face of his mother without able to do anything.
No one of the <unk> because they were very worried about taking them and their families.
A huge larvae would be able to North Korea in the North <unk>
At the end, more than a million years died in the <unk> and just a few rooms eating <unk> insects and cerebral
They also made more and more <unk> the <unk> of energy, all of my around around the night except by the ground of the sea in China, you can barely run the river from my house.
I always asked me why they had light and we don't.
This is a picture of North Korea in the night compared to the countries.
This is the <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> of the limit between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing them to <unk> <unk>
But many numbers.
Sometimes I saw the bodies floating on the market.
I can't reveal the details of how I went from North Korea and I just can say that for the years of the <unk> I went to China to live with <unk>
But I just thought it would be a school of my family for a long time.
I could never have imagined that it was 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how to be the life as a <unk> <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely hard, but it's also dangerous, because the religious refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destiny in North Carolina.
One day, my worst friend was made when I went up for the Chinese police and <unk> in the police station,
Someone had been hearing by being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and made me many questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to do it.
If you didn't seem natural -- it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to go.
But I started to control my emotions and it was the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a film told another other, "This was a <unk> She was not <unk>
And I asked me to go. It was a miracle.
Some years ago in China they are going to go back in <unk> <unk>
But many of you can be released by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of lucky.
Although the <unk> had eventually put up after a international pressure.
These years didn't have so lucky.
Every year, we spent years -- it's built in China and <unk> to North Korea where they're <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Although I was lucky in <unk> many other years haven't had so lucky.
It's tragic that the 1950s, have to hide their eyes and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work, all its world can be <unk> in a second.
It's why after 10 years of hide my identity, I've decided to go back to South Korea in the study.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a lot more than what I was born.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a great gap between North and Darfur.
We are all <unk> but we have come to be very different because of <unk> years of <unk>
I even went to a design crisis.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where do you say about where I think of that?
I had no country that I could call a country to call me with me.
Even though it comes to the life in South Korea in the South South Korea was not easy, I started studying for the <unk> <unk>
Right when I was beginning to <unk> my new life, I got a <unk>
The authorities from North North North North Korea -- something of money who sent my family, and as I understood my family was going to be <unk> to the force in the <unk>
They had to get them to get it away.
And so I started to convince how to help you help it.
The years, they have to travel a long way in the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and North Carolina.
So we took a flight to China and it comes to the border with North Carolina.
So my family couldn't talk about Chinese, I had to be <unk> in some of three miles through China and then through Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and almost we were involved several times.
One time, our bus was asked and changed by an Chinese continent.
I went to all of all of all of all of all, and they started asking questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese Richard came to my family <unk> I put me back and I said that they were <unk> I was <unk>
I looked at <unk> but I can turn it around.
We did all the way to the <unk> <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to interpret the <unk> <unk>
But even after you can happen that my family was <unk> and incarcerated to cross the <unk>
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was taken in a month,
But at time, my family was <unk> and incarcerated over the capital of <unk>
This was one of the most high points in my life.
I did all to bring my family and we were so close to my family, and my family was <unk> in prison to short distance of the <unk>
I was and came out between the office office and the police station, trying to inspire my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more <unk> or <unk>
I lost hope.
In that time, or the voice of a man say, "What is the <unk>
I was so surprised that a product is so excited about.
With my poor English and with a dictionary I explained the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other two years -- and it gave me from prison.
I was <unk> with all my heart, and I said, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> I said.
I am helping people <unk>
I realized that was a moment in my life.
And the kind of <unk> a new hope for me and for the village -- when more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of the <unk> and the support of the international community are really aware of hope that the <unk> people.
And after the time, after our long journey, my family and I went on in South Carolina.
But you get their freedom is just half the <unk>
A lot of years are sold from their families and when you take a new country, they start with little or nothing of money.
So we can benefit out of the international community with education, and <unk> and <unk> and more.
We can also act as the bridge of people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us we continue in contact with family with family -- and we're still able to change North North Korea from inside.
Now I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of helps and inspiration in my life, so I want to help them take a lot of <unk> a chance to fight international <unk>
I'm sure you're going to see more and more <unk> <unk> around the world, including in the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I live in South Asia.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So the way of the city of the city came together, and they said, we're going to change the name of the company, so it turns out something else, so they changed the Los Angeles as if this is what is actually wrong in the city.
This is the Los Angeles --  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same like that <unk> millions of other Americans live in a desert. The Los Angeles Center home home from the places of food and eat in the car.
The curious is that the places of food to bring people more people than the food in the car.
People are dying of infectious diseases in Los Angeles.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times more that, say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I was going to see that this does.
And I wonder how you would be able to be able to make access to the healthy food and if every time you go from home you look at the <unk> effects that the system of our food system has in its <unk>
I see a <unk> <unk> and they can turn it as a <unk>
I saw <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I think that this must help you.
I think the problem is solution.
<unk> is the problem and it's the solution.
In addition to me to take a lot of 45 minutes of <unk> and go back to buy a apple that doesn't have <unk>
And what I did, was we got a heart of food <unk>
In one of the land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 to me, three me.
The point is, that is the city.
But you have to get it on.
I said, "Well, I can do what I come on in <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to be <unk>
So it was like I decided to be able to get it on.
And so my group and I, <unk> <unk> <unk> we put up and we started the forest of food, trees -- trees -- you know, the nine brothers -- you know, the nine objects.
What we do, we are a kind of broken group on the end of all the <unk> all the <unk> of all the city and completely <unk> and everything we do is free.
And the guy was beautiful.
And then somebody was <unk>
The city came to me on and I had a <unk> saying that I had to take my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I said, "Hey, in right?
A global order for 10 food in a piece of land that no one <unk>  So I was like, "Well, I was like, "Well, <unk>
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
The Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of <unk> <unk> that they put a <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, let's see what right?
Life is the city of America with more <unk>
It has <unk> miles <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That is a enough to plant <unk> billion plants of <unk>
Why does it not look like this?
<unk> a plant will give a lot of <unk>
When a dollar of <unk> you give you a <unk>
It's my <unk> when I tell people people, you get your own food.
<unk> your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Asia.
I grew up there.
And I was <unk> to be part of this really <unk> that was <unk> for me for each other, and I'm going to take my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I think of my art.
Maybe as a artist of <unk> that <unk> -- I <unk> <unk> <unk>
I use the <unk> the land, as a piece of <unk> and the plants and trees, are my <unk> of that technology.
You know, you see what the land can be able to do.
You just can't imagine the amazing thing that is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm going to remember how my garden became a tool of education, of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
They are <unk> to see how to the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
You get <unk>
I remember a page that came up with a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my desk, and they look very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt wrong that they were there, and I said, you know, they don't have to do this like this.
This is in the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who was so close to me, and this is just that why do I do this, the why people do this, the people are going to give me that people are going to give your <unk>
So I say, "Why don't I have afraid you go to <unk>
So that's in the street.
That's why it is.
I want to be the <unk> but I want to take it your <unk>
There was another time where I put a car in a shelter for <unk> in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys who helped me download the <unk>
It was <unk> I took me their stories about how this was <unk> and how it used to plant it with his mom and his grandmother, and it was a lot of seeing how this works so just for a moment.
And so <unk> <unk> has come to 10 <unk>
We've got up as about 50 people who are going to work and <unk> all of them in it.
If the kids are going to get <unk> the kids are going to be <unk>
If you go to <unk> you will go <unk>  But if nothing of this is <unk> if you don't teach them how your food affects your mind and the body, they eat a lot of what they put up in front of you.
I look at young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which you're going to see -- I look at kids who are in this way it designed to them, who doesn't take them to any side.
With <unk> I see a chance where we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who says,
Maybe you get the next George Washington, <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never do it.
Now this is one of my <unk> this is something I want to do.
I want to plant all one of a babies, where people can share food in the same time.
I want to take it <unk> and turn it into <unk>
I don't know me.
I'm not talking about good things, because it is not sustainable.
The curious of sustainability, is you have to be <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people from the people, take the kids from the street, you know the <unk> the pride and the honor and the honor and the honor to grow their own food, <unk> markets.
And what I want to do here, we have to make it <unk>
I want all to become <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have to change the list of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
And what the <unk> take her <unk> right?
What that is your gun of choice.
In <unk> if you want to write with me, well, if you want to write it, I don't call me if you want to sit in a very fast player and have to get meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some of it.
If you want to show you to come up to the garden with her <unk> so that we can plant something.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>  You probably have to agree with me in which this is a very small way.
It's made of <unk> and <unk> is a good material to convince but not always, not in days like today, instead of a lot.
You can have a great amount of water in the <unk> that <unk>
And especially if you're going to focus on their bicycle and these cars get that is not really nice.
We can do a lot of noise.
It's a reasonable material, and if we build <unk> as in the United States is very close to cities, we want a <unk>
The solution for that is to make <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads in the United States is <unk> and the water can move through it, so all the water of the water goes into the sides and you get a road why it's easy to be easy and not <unk> water.
The noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's so far -- all the noise -- so it is a very sophisticated road that is a very long way.
It also has <unk> of course, and the <unk> of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> you see that in this road the rocks on the surface of the surface.
First of a certificate -- then several more and more and more and more and more and more and more, and you can be able to do it.  But they can not be happy with it.
And finally, this can also bring more and more harm.
Sometimes you can create it with that.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can see how it looks really how the damage in this material.
It's a <unk> <unk> as I said, so it just has a small amount of <unk> between the <unk>
Because the <unk> to the light to the light to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> and if you <unk> you are going to be <unk> and you get out of the <unk>
So, if you get on the road, you get the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then you probably have a solution.
So what we can do is to use <unk> <unk> from that to clean <unk> and we can cut the <unk> <unk> and we can cut up these little pieces with the <unk>
So we have <unk> with small pieces of <unk> <unk> in it.
And then you need a machine, like the one that you see here, you use it to <unk> a <unk>
<unk> can <unk> especially <unk> is very good in it.
So what you have to do is <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> is the <unk> by these <unk> and the rocks are going to get back back to the surface.
I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great machine <unk> here on the stage.
<unk> <unk> is a similar system.
I put the sculpture that now I'm going to take to see what happened.
This is the shows that it comes now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We took a lot of samples there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to be <unk>
So we took us a piece of road, 400 feet from the <unk> <unk> where we had to do a clinical <unk> to test this material.
So that was what we did on there. You see where we were doing the test in the road, and then, of course, this road last several years without <unk> which is what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and we test them in the lab.
We did that, then we did that, we put a lot of <unk> we put a lot of <unk> in them, the <unk> then with our <unk> <unk> and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can take this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we have made a material using <unk> fibers -- we can actually increase the life of the surface of the surface of the road, even you can see the life of the surface of the surface of the road, you can even save a lot of money with very simple.
And now, of course, they have curious if this was also working.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to think about the first before you can show you how to look at it.
But I'm going to do a <unk>
So I worked.
Thank you.
When I had 11 years ago, I remember I remember a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to end up in their small radio radio <unk>
I had a great smile in his face that was unusual in those time, because the news usually <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
You know, you can go to a <unk> school <unk>
One morning I never believe.
A real school.
You see, I had six years ago when the Taliban come out of Afghanistan and they made it illegal that girls were to school.
For the next five years ago, I was <unk> as a kid to <unk> my older sister that I couldn't be used to go out to a <unk> school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we took a different way that no one could be able to know where it was <unk>
We had to hide the books in building the market, so it seems to be <unk>
The school was in a house, more than 100 percent of the <unk>
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
All we knew that <unk> our <unk> the students and our parents.
Instead of when the school is a week for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always know what they knew what they knew it.
They were <unk>
Did you know where they were <unk>
We were <unk> but still the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and they were a <unk>
My grandfather was a extraordinary man for his time.
A total of a total <unk> from a island of a remote <unk> in which his daughter, my mother, was to the school and so his father was <unk>
But my mother was turned away.
This is it.
It took two years ago, just to turn our home in school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, it was the first of their family in being education.
There was no doubt that their kids had to get education, even their miles despite the <unk> despite the <unk>
He had a greater risk in not to educate their children.
For the years of the <unk> I remember that there was a few moments that I was very frustrated for our life, and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to say, but my father said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you can lose everything that you have in life.
You can pay your money. You can be able to leave your house for a war.
But there is one thing that always will be talking about it, which is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we can do.
So you still want to do not <unk>
I have 22 years.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades, of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the time, and if my family didn't have been so excited with my education, I would be a <unk>
Instead, I'm going to find here proud of <unk> <unk>
When I went to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from his home for the <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>
He wasn't just <unk> from my college title but also that I was the first woman, and I am the first woman that I went back on the streets of <unk>
My family thinks in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even greater dreams for <unk>
It's why I'm the global <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's why we <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only public school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still going to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see the students in my school with the strong desire to take the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families that as the <unk> <unk> for them, and even in front of a <unk>
As a <unk> is not his real name, and I can't show you your face, but it wasn't the father of one of my students.
And less than a month, he and his daughter was going to go out from <unk> towards his village, and literally the <unk> of being killed by a bomb in the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, you are the phone, a voice -- a voice -- a voice that if I was still sending his daughter to school, they would get it to me.
<unk> -- if you were <unk> he said, "Yes, not not identify the future of my daughter for their old and <unk>
And what I've been given in Afghanistan, and it's something that is often sitting in the West, is that behind most of those who are <unk> there is a father who took the value of his daughter and you see that the success of her own success.
I don't want to say that our mothers have no key to our success.
In fact, it often is the first <unk> <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
<unk> the <unk> the girls who were the school who were going to come into school -- remember it was dead.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan, you see so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the world of changes.
<unk> that these changes were not a lot after the ice of the U.S. government.
But when you go back to Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and their parents who <unk> for them, that <unk> I see a <unk> future and a change change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and chances of <unk> and every day the girls were <unk>
As I, they would take it in big.
Thank you.
Probably I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But you never come up with a <unk> <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution was born by the <unk> <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A little forces with a lot of other citizens <unk> within and outside the country to call a day and start a revolution against the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And they <unk> it was a big revolution.
Women and men -- young young men were in the <unk> <unk> the each of the <unk> and <unk> freedom, dignity and social justice.
They have shown a <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk>
You have shown a great sense of <unk> from the <unk> East, until the south, to the south,
Finally, after a period of six months of war and a bunch of about about 50 years ago, we were able to bring our country and <unk> to the <unk>
However, <unk> I left a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and seeds of <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> <unk> <unk> the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the <unk> and the challenges, I've got back along a lot of other women, to rebuild the <unk> society -- <unk> a transition and <unk> to democracy and <unk>
And there are about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after each of the <unk> <unk> 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of <unk> I went to interested and with a single child, I began to organize flowers about the development of <unk> and skills of leadership.
With a incredible group of women we tried to take the <unk> <unk> <unk> by the <unk> a movement of women, leaders of the <unk> and for the <unk> of the <unk> and the right of the <unk> <unk> in the building of democracy and peace.
I found it with a very hard environment in the period of a <unk> environment, a environment that was every time more <unk> than the <unk> policies and <unk>
With the time, our environment was supposed to get it and <unk>
Women won a <unk> Congress in the first time in 40 years.
However, a little bit at a little bit, the <unk> of the choices and the revolution as a everything, were <unk> all the days we found for violence.
And one day we put up with the news of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the magnitude of the U.S. and the heart of the <unk>
Another day we put up with the news the news of the <unk> <unk>
And every day, every day, every day we put up with the government government and their <unk> of the human rights rights and their lack of the human rights and their lack of the law.
Our society, I made the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and it has come out of the ideals and the principles of freedom, making social justice social justice -- that we had the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> became the <unk> of the revolution of the revolution.
I'm not here today in all to <unk> with our history of the <unk> <unk> and the election.
More -- I'm here today that we know that us, as blue we choose wrong, we take the wrong solution.
We don't do well.
Because the choices didn't make peace, the stability and the security to solve.
The list of <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> brought peace and <unk>
No, they didn't do it.
What happened to happen?
Why our society is still <unk> and the map with political policies and <unk> both of men as for women?
Maybe what they were supposed to were not just women, but the hydrogen values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national sector, and the creation of consensus more than that we needed the world that just <unk> and <unk>
Our nation you need to be <unk> <unk> of the more that we need to be able to be <unk> and <unk>
We need to leave you to act as agents of <unk> and call it to a couple of <unk>
We need to start to act like compassion and <unk>
We need to develop an extra speech that not just <unk> but also it also put it in practice the <unk> instead of the <unk> the collaboration instead of the <unk> and the <unk> instead of the <unk>
And these are the ideals that is the ideals that an explanation.
Because peace has a <unk> which is a <unk> which is about the <unk> and the <unk> between the <unk> and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish the one of a risk before you do it <unk>
And according to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> that you know in all of the <unk> <unk> it has the same slide in America, that the word <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that it comes to all of the humanity that men and women, than all the tribes and all people have <unk>
And so, at the same like the <unk> has a completely completely <unk> that grows on the <unk> and the main <unk> of compassion is the whole thing.
And so it says, "I'm <unk> <unk>
And so it says, "I'm <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
What all of you are going to get out of the <unk>
Thank you.
I'm here today today to talk about a question that has a good response that has a good response to do it.
It's about the secrets of violence -- and the question I'm going to be going to be able to be the ones that all they do <unk> Why was it <unk>
Why was somebody to stay with a man who <unk>
I am not <unk> or social behavior, not <unk>
I'm just a woman with a story.
I had 22 years old. I had been <unk> in the University of Harvard.
I had moved to New York to my first work as an American <unk>
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> my first <unk> <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many time, the man, that I create my head <unk> I was going to come up to the head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, when I loved more than one in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times that I can love it.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> where every year of women, and even some men.
It could be their story.
I don't have a typical typical of violence in the ground.
I'm <unk> in English University and I have a <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>
I've spent the most part of my career working in the list of the list of the list of the list of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I'm almost 20 years ago with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that violence can happen to hear all of the <unk> all the <unk> and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that all people think that violence is about women, which is a problem of women.
I don't know.
More than about 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the <unk> <unk> only happens in relationships <unk> <unk> and the last place where we would want to or we want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to find out of the reason that you might be able to be able to find out of the reason
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would be able to be the last person in the world that was <unk> and I made it a very typical victim because of my age.
I had 22 years ago, and in the United States, the women from the age of 16 and 24 years of age have three times more chances of being victims of violence than the other <unk> and more than 500 women are killed every year by <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the United States.
I also went a typical victim because I didn't know anything about violence -- their signals and their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, and the night of January.
I was sitting on my side in the subway City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first was that he also had just had a <unk> of a college <unk> and I worked in a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what else was struck me in that first encounter was that was ready and fun, and it seemed a guy in the field.
I had a lot of great <unk> as you are, and a <unk> <unk> and it seemed so strong.
One of the most smart things that made <unk> since the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He made it all of the <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
So we started to go out and I loved all of me, that was <unk> that I had been the late that I would put passion to help girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and <unk>
<unk> believed in me, as a child and as a woman had ever done it.
And it was why the people in that <unk> school and the work in Wall Street and their brilliant future had so much importance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of violence is <unk> and <unk> to it.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now the last thing that I wanted to do was come from my York -- and I leave the work of my dreams, but I thought there was that I had to do it for your partner so I was <unk> and I left my work and <unk> and we went together and we went together and then we went together in Manhattan.
I didn't have no idea that I was based on a <unk> <unk> who was going to go on head in a artificial physics, and <unk> <unk>
The next step in the <unk> of violence is to introduce the power of violence to see how to do it.
And here's where they walk in the scene of <unk>
In the way we moved to New York -- you know, that place where it was supposed to feel so sure I had to feel so sure I bought three <unk>
One of the <unk>
Another turned underneath the <unk> in our homes, and the third always in his pocket.
And I said that I needed these <unk> cause the <unk> that lived in small time.
I needed to feel safe.
But those <unk> actually was a message for me and even though I had never been the hand, my life, my life was because I was a lot of <unk> every minute in every day.
The first heart of <unk> was spent five days before our feet.
They were seven of the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 percent of my neck had got me to me my mother and married me with him.
Despite what there was actually sure I was sure that we were happy to always, because I loved it, and he also wanted to write it, and he also wanted to write it.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was just a very <unk> sense of the wedding and the fact that we make a family with me.
There was a single accident and I never would be able to do it.
I spent two times more in our moon of it.
The first time I was invited to a secret beach and I was <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that we have a lot of times on the head of the car.
And then a couple of days later, he went back from the back of our <unk> <unk> and he took me a Big call to the face.
<unk> <unk> <unk> one or two times for the next two years of the next two years and a half years.
I was <unk> when I thought was the only in this situation.
One of every three women, Americans is <unk> from education, or <unk> in some time of life, and the <unk> <unk> that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
I'm going to go back to my question: Why do I be <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was <unk>
At the contrary, I was a very strong woman -- in a <unk> man.
The other question that all the world makes is why it is just not <unk>
Why did I didn't be <unk> I could have been in any time.
For me this is the most sad question that people people, because we do the people, because we have the <unk> we know something that are usually <unk> it's incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase in the health pattern is <unk>
More than 70 percent of 70 percent of the <unk> in cases of violence today, after the <unk> has been the end of the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to be.
Other <unk> <unk> <unk> even after the <unk> has gone to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> from the solar system for <unk> <unk> <unk> and their kids who usually are forced by the <unk> to spend time <unk> with the man who are going to get to his mom.
And so we're still asking you asking what they just don't look like.
I was able to talk to the cause of a last <unk> I was going to take my finger.
I realized that the man who would love so I would have killed if you were <unk>
So I got the silence.
I told you all the world on the police to the police to my neighbors, to my neighbors and I was here today because you all have you <unk>
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims like headlines <unk> women <unk>
The question, "Why are you <unk>
And for some people is a way to say, "The <unk> is <unk> by <unk> as if the victims of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard about hundreds of men of men and women who also <unk> that I learned that I learned that I learned that I learned that we learned and <unk> their life lives and creative lives like <unk> wives and mothers are completely free lives of violence, like my mine.
Because it turns out that I really am a victim and a <unk> of violence in life.
I went to come up with a <unk> man and sort of those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What you don't go back to have never even more likely to have never even more, it's a <unk> <unk> <unk> to my head in the hands of somebody who says to me.
In this time, as you are thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what was a really been talking about you.
I assure you that there is a few people, from the ones who are hearing right right now, which are being <unk> or that they were <unk>
<unk> could be used to their daughter, to his sister, to their best friend now.
I was able to put the end of my favorite love <unk> the silence.
And I still work today.
It's my way to help other people -- and it's my last journey to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
The <unk> only in silence.
They have the power to end up with violence -- you just take light on it.
The victims we need all the world.
We need to make each of you understand the secrets of violence.
<unk> the art to the light talking about that with their children, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of the used as a fantastic people and <unk> who have a <unk> future.
<unk> the signs of violence in violence for <unk> <unk> to sell their <unk> and show the victims of a <unk>
And so we can turn our <unk> our <unk> our <unk> and our families in the <unk> and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call it <unk> <unk> and since a time, I'm model.
To be <unk> for 10 years.
And I feel that in this moment there is an famous tension in the room because it doesn't have <unk> like --    luckily, I've got their bones for <unk>
This is the first change of her in a stage <unk> so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when you were <unk> you don't have to be <unk> now, but we find more late in Twitter.
I also want to point that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in so just 10 seconds.
Not all the world has that opportunity.
These are very <unk> less wrong than I don't have to be able to use.
The worst thing is going to happen on the head, because it's when you go to me, so you don't do anything as a head of my head.
All right.
Why do I do this?
It's been wrong.
Well, I hope not as this photo.
<unk> is powerful, but it's also <unk>
I've changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this photo, I had never had a <unk> in real life.
I was completely <unk> and the process, I said to me that I was going to go on the back and I was going to get the <unk>
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial theory, as I took me two days for work, there is very little that we can do to transform our way, which is that, but even though <unk> and <unk> has a huge impact in our lives.
So today, for me, it's a lot to be <unk>
I'm in this stage because I am a model.
Because I am a beautiful woman and white, and in my life, that is being a reasonable girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always does, but we can be <unk>
The first question is, how you get it to be <unk>
And I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made me model is because he won the <unk> and I am the <unk> of a <unk> and it is the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're asking what this is?
Well, in the last centuries of the last centuries is not only defined the beauty as health, and <unk> which we are <unk> that we are associated with the <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> and a white skin and a white skin and a white skin,
And that is my elephant that I've been known to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience that now shows you <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> to know that we can know that we can know that we can know so much we can build models.
But unfortunately, I have to read that in 2007, a graduate student from the University of the University of New York told all and each of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> is -- I mean, less of four percent, didn't be <unk>
The next question that people will always ask me is, you can be a model when it is <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't don't know about it.
But then what I really would say about every one of these girls is why you can be what you can.
You can be <unk> from the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> <unk> and then it would be <unk> because you would get the first.
If after this list of this list <unk> No, no, no, I want to be model, then I say, I know my <unk>
Because I am not about nothing, and you could be the head of the <unk> magazine or <unk> <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
Because you want to be a model is like to say you want to win the notion when you be more than you will be.
It's out of your control, it's <unk> and it's not a job that you can choose it.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years like model is already that unlike surgery <unk> can be <unk> right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have to take your studies, and you have a <unk> and a lot of jobs to your God, you don't matter what I <unk> is say, if you <unk> that you want to be President of the United States, but you get your <unk> <unk> from her inside 10 years -- people would look very weird.
The next question that people always makes me is if all the pictures is <unk>
And yeah, it's almost <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a little part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even had my day.
I know that we're coming into the personal ground, but it was a girl.
And so I went along with my grandmother with a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
So here I'm in a <unk> <unk> a few days before the pictures for the <unk>
So here I am with my football team and in the New York Times.
And this is I like this.
And I hope you have to realize that I am not me in those photos.
They are <unk> from a <unk> group <unk> and <unk> and all of their <unk> and all of their <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always do is <unk> <unk>
I have a lot of a lot of 20 inches and that you never have a couple of 20 inches -- but the answer that I get in the real life, and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and I forgot to take money, and I forgot to take them money, and he gave me the daily <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was playing with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and of course, we <unk> and <unk> a <unk> and <unk> and <unk> a <unk> to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> from these <unk> for my way, not why I am.
I live in New York, and the year of the <unk> the teenagers who had been done and <unk> four percent were black and bees and most of them were young men.
And just there are a lot of <unk> young black young women, in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
But how many times I <unk>
At doing this talk for this talk, I learned that the 80 percent of the girls in 13 years in the United States don't like your body, and that we think that we look at the 70 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is, How is the life of a <unk>
And I think the answer that you expect to say is, if you're a little bit more <unk> and you have the <unk> -- you get very happy and <unk>
And behind the cameras, we give a answer that maybe it <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful, and also incredible power to work with creative people and <unk>
And all of that is the way, but it's just a part of what happens because what we never say that because what we never said in front of them, what I never said in front of them, what I never said in front of them, I mean, I am a <unk>
And I am because I have to worry about my whole day.
And if you ever ask you with a lot of a little little legs and the small hair will be more happy.
You just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs -- the most <unk> legs -- and the more <unk> women -- but you probably be the <unk> women in the planet.
But about it was hard to look at a <unk> situation, and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If you have something that I have to hide from this talk, I hope that you all have more comfortable to recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have about success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since it was the greatest enough to get a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't have to have the <unk>
There was no <unk> <unk> or no chance to replicate the pictures, not even a huge care in the <unk>
In fact, most of them came up to take it up to random.
My story starts when I was <unk> in the city of New York to give a <unk> my wife, my wife, I got this photo on the day in the day of his first birthday. That's the corner.
He took the point that we went to New York -- just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you see, what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my daughter, my wife, my wife told me, why don't you take you to take it to the <unk> to New York in a <unk> journey, and you get the <unk>
Here is when we start to ask them to take them to take them to take them the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a completely dangerous <unk>
No no one has been known and luckily, you have never been <unk> with the camera.
So we were not aware how much we change the life this journey.
It became a proposal for us.
This picture is about a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain my daughter what I had happened that day that day that day that day that day that day that day that day that day that day that day a little bit of a <unk>
And these pictures are a lot more than <unk> in a particular time or a virtual journey.
It's also a way to stop the time in a week of October and we think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not just the physical level, but in all the <unk>
Because even though you always take the same picture, our emotional perspective, my daughter has a lot of new <unk> and I can see life through their eyes and how it comes and interact with it.
That time in particular, that we spend together is something that we hope with the whole year.
Recently, in one of the <unk> we were able to put them up, when I sudden, it was a sudden, they stopped the <unk> and a red <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And he described me what I had sense about five years on the same place.
<unk> that <unk> their <unk> heart with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what it looks at in New York are <unk> because it's interested to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things that we create is <unk>
So I want to share the idea of participate in the creation of <unk>
I don't know you, but some of these 15 pictures, I don't walk in many of the other <unk>
I'm always going to take the picture.
Today, I want to leave you all to go on the photo, and they don't get it into somebody and <unk> we take them a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about a very special group of animals.
There are 10 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the group of the most <unk>
First of all, why do you have as bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney <unk> <unk> like characters <unk> <unk>
More recently, if you have been following the United States <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> these are the attributes that they associated with <unk> <unk> but not it.
I don't know it, you know about what?
Because the members of 2006, they don't keep the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the <unk>
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>       There are two types of <unk> in this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New York who are mainly in the <unk> as the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk>
So why are the <unk> they're important, in the first place, provide financial services, <unk>
They're our <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> all the bacteria.
A recent survey have shown that in areas where there's no <unk> you take in three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge <unk> in the use of disease.
<unk> also have huge <unk>
They've been associated in the ancient culture of <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the <unk> and the windows and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the <unk> and in Egypt.
In the <unk> <unk> <unk> was the God <unk> and <unk> their life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the culture of <unk> you have a lot of very important <unk> to sky machines in places like <unk> there is no place to take it up or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide an natural system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are in the end of which six are in the end of the <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that are being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this version against the conditions, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In the south of Asia, in countries like India and 2007, four species of <unk> which means that in least 10 or 15 years ago, it means that in least 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they can be treated with a drug drug like <unk>
And this drug has been able to bring up in India and have taken a <unk>
Because there is no <unk> has been a bird in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> it has a huge bomb for time for <unk> the number of cases has been engaged in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the greatest mass of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> are going to be on the lake <unk>
I'm not against the energy wind, but we have to work with governments, because the wind communication, they do this to <unk> <unk> <unk>
They're <unk>
In Africa -- there are a horrible <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and the market <unk>
So what is you doing? Well, we're doing these things, we are <unk> <unk>
We are trying to determine your basic <unk> and see where they go.
We can see that you go around the different countries, so we can see it in a professional problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with government in the <unk>
We're working with the local communities.
We are talking to them with them to see the <unk> about the need to see these wonderful creatures and the services that <unk>
How can you <unk> it can be <unk> to make noise. You can write a letter to his government and tell you we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go from this room, you would be able to learn about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their kids, with their neighbors on the <unk>
These are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that it changed the opinion because they saw it without <unk> without <unk> <unk>
Kenya, this world, being more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing that I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> by seven years of work for my age in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> -- but I didn't write it.  I worked in Bangladesh Kenya, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I worked for a <unk> <unk> and every project that we made in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the 1980s, we were good people and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, all of what they <unk> <unk>
Our first project, the who inspired my first book, <unk> <unk> was a project where we were a few <unk> we decided to teach people to move food food.
So we came up with seeds <unk> in the south of the south of the south of the south of the <unk> <unk> and we teach the local to our <unk> and we teach the local to grow <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, the people were not in all interested in making sure what they were <unk> to come to work, and some time, they didn't be <unk>  We were <unk> that the water in that <unk> <unk> didn't have had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible to be possible to do that, you just said, "Thank my God that we're here --  <unk> for the time to save the people from <unk>
And of course, all in Africa are <unk>
We've got these <unk> <unk> in Italy, a force would grow to this size.
And we can't believe what we were saying we were saying to the <unk> how easy is <unk>
When the <unk> were <unk> <unk> and carbon from the night to the morning, about 200 <unk> came from the river and they said,  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> they said, "Yes, why we don't have agriculture here --  "Why don't do it <unk> <unk>
I thought that only of us were <unk> <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans were doing it, what they were doing the <unk> what they did the <unk> and then you see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in the picture.
Because as you see, the less we can see the <unk>
You can see the <unk>   <unk> see the <unk> that they were going to take them to the <unk> people in Africa.
It wants to read a book, I read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in it.
We've given the United States, we have given the African continent two billion dollars in the last 50 years.
I don't tell you about the damage that the money has <unk>
Just read his book.
<unk> from a solar woman that we've made.
The Western we're <unk> <unk> <unk> and we try to have only two <unk> or <unk> or we're <unk>
And the two words comes from the ancient root <unk> which means <unk>
However, it means two different things.
I try to try to ask any of a different culture as if you were my kids, "I want a lot of time.
<unk> I try all of a different culture as if you were my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a <unk> in the face.
This is the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put up this conference on the floor and said, we can know you you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to the 27 years just answer people -- and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you have never close to us, but it turns out in a <unk> of the local passion the <unk> of the local passion the <unk> of the local passion who have the dream to become a better person.
So what does you do about it <unk>
They get it to a community with an idea, and they feel with the people from the <unk>
We don't work from the office.
We found them in a coffee. We found them in a slides.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do we do in friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you a idea to somebody.
If that person don't want to do that what is going to do it.
The passion that she has for their own growth is the most important thing.
And the passion that that man has to their own personal growth is the most important.
And then we help them to find the knowledge because no one in the world can have success alone.
The person with the idea can not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years ago, and years ago, I had this idea: Why do not us, for one time instead of a community to tell people what to do, why do you do that, for one time, they <unk> but it wasn't in <unk>
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with <unk>
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never be able to be in a public meeting, what you want to do with their own money, what opportunity have been made.
So design has this kind of <unk>
The most smart people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't get to their public <unk>
What do we do we do we do we do -- and we have face face to work, you have to create a social infrastructure, which is no longer exists.
You must create a new <unk>
<unk> is the family member of the company, the medical medical doctor who has been connected with you in their house, in the table and they helps them to find the resources to transform their passion in a way of a <unk>
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia of Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia of Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia of Australia in Australia of Australia in
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to go from this molecule, they get to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects in <unk> and the government came to me to see how you can do that?
How can <unk> I said, <unk> something very, very hard.
I was <unk> and <unk> --   And so the government says, <unk> <unk>  So we've done in 300 communities in the world.
We've used to start 40 business.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of the time.
Peter <unk> one of the most <unk> <unk> <unk> of the story, went to the <unk> a few years.
Peter <unk> was a philosophy of philosophy, before they live in business, and this is what says, Peter <unk> <unk> is actually <unk> with a society and a economy economy.
<unk> is the magnitude of the death of the death of the death of the business.
So now you know, now you know, <unk> <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn that these people are going to get to talk with you.
You have to give you to give you to you, you have to be great to the <unk> and then you get it into mass.
In one community of 10 people, we get 200 properties.
You can imagine a community of 400 people -- intelligence and <unk>
What do you look at you have been <unk> over this <unk>
People <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I'm going to say is that the computer spirit is where the solar spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- <unk> <unk> <unk> and a moment of another, we have systems that are not <unk>
The engine engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to support <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to think, is how <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to seven billion people, in a virtual way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for the <unk> revolution <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
They can be the entrepreneurs and they are doing it now.
There is a kind of a story that I was in a <unk> magazine a lot of years.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city in New York in the year <unk>
And in the year of the year of the year, they took this group of people -- and <unk> this group of people to happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York -- and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York -- not the city within 100 years.
Why? Because it comes to the curve and <unk> if the population is going to grow up to this <unk> to bring the population of New York to <unk> <unk> six million <unk> and <unk> over six million pictures, it would be impossible to be.
They were already <unk> in <unk>  And so in <unk> they were <unk> this favorite technology that <unk> the life of New York.
So what does you think about the next 40 years in 1900, in the United States in the United States, in the United States, in the United States.
The idea of find a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very busy <unk> in places -- <unk>
<unk> <unk>
However, there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First first, you have to give you a <unk>
In another way, they don't go to talk with you.
Then you have to give you a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then you have to tell you to tell you the truth with about <unk>
The smallest company the greatest company has to be able to do three things -- <unk> the product that you want to sell you have to be <unk> you have to tell you with a beautiful <unk> and you have to tell you with a <unk> <unk>
You know what?
We have been known to a only human being in the world that can do, sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've observed and looked at the 100 companies all of the world -- <unk> <unk> <unk> all of the social companies <unk>
There is just one thing that all companies in the world have in common world have in common -- no one was used by a single person.
I mean, the word is, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He was not just when it worked.
No one has a company as a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come out of a small business environment -- <unk> in <unk> along their <unk> <unk> who are going to be about this gentleman who talk about this gentleman who talk about this gentleman -- somebody who talk about this gentleman -- somebody who will ask you, what would you think about it.
What can you do it, you can do it.
Well, you can <unk> it can look for <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> <unk>
We build communities.
Thank you.
Those of us can help us have a lot of ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't think about knowledge despite share the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space with very simple tools like <unk> <unk>
And these projects came from questions like, how much they pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and ask more things without call the door in a bad map.
How do we share more memories of our rich buildings and understanding better our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes to the laboratory, cows so that our communities can reflect today our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm born in New <unk>
And my soul will always be able to be able to be able to be a <unk> <unk> that give them to <unk> <unk> and <unk> from centuries and I think about centuries -- and I think about centuries and I think about centuries and I think about centuries and I think about centuries and I think about centuries and I think about centuries and I think about centuries and
And there is always giving the music.  There is a <unk> in New York <unk>   The city has one of the most beautiful <unk> of the world, but also one with the greatest properties of the United States.
I live close to this house and thought how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
his death was <unk> and <unk>
I thought a lot of death and I thought a lot of death and I thought a lot of death and I thought a lot of death and I thought a lot of death and I thought a lot of death and I thought a lot of death and I thought a lot of death and I thought a lot of death and I thought a lot of death and
And this brings me a profound good thing for time and the living time.
He gave them to make the significant things in my life.
But it was <unk> by keep this look at my own life.
It seems to be easy to go to the day and forget the really important for one.
So with the age of old and new friends became the wall of this house in a giant <unk> and he wrote on her phrases to <unk> <unk> <unk>
So the <unk> they could take a <unk> thinking about their lives and share some personal ideas in the public space.
I didn't know what about this experiment but at the next day the wall was <unk> and I was born <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote in the wall.
I thought about dying I want to be <unk>   I didn't have to sit on <unk> in the line of <unk>
I thought about dying I want to sing for millions of <unk>
I had to die -- I want to get a <unk>
I thought I want to live outside of the <unk>
He tried to die -- I want to take it a time.
He tried to die I want to go to the <unk>
I had to die I want to be completely <unk>
This particular space has been <unk> and the dreams and hope of the people who did me <unk> I was <unk> and they gave me to be <unk> and they gave me to me to be a difficult moments in times.
It's about knowing that one is not going to understand our neighbors of new ways and <unk> is about giving them to the thought and the <unk> is about giving the <unk> and the <unk> and to remember what the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started to get hundreds of messages from people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the way that with my colleagues, we did it and now they have done walls in countries around the world, as <unk> Africa, Australia, known and over there.
And so we would imagine the power of our public spaces, if we give the opportunity to try to share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are the time and our relationships with other people.
In our age was <unk> it's more important that we could find the ways to get the perspective and remember that life is short and <unk>
The death is something that often we were going to talk about, or even thinking, but I understood that we could be able to be a death is one of those things that we are going to give us more power.
I think in death <unk> our life.
Our special spaces, can be better what we care like individuals and as a community and most means to share <unk> fears and stories, people who are not only able to help us improve places can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single story.
Please don't tell you that I'm normal.
I would like to introduce you to my <unk>
<unk> has 22 years ago, it's high and very hot.
I don't know it, but it takes better than some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what the love.
The <unk> is going to be able to do what it does.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care the religious differences and notice in this: never has been <unk>
When I was afraid of our childhood, trying to show you the words that I didn't even know about the mind and the wonderful thing that you know about the mind and the wonderful thing that should be the idea.
He has 16 years old. It's <unk> It's very hot.
<unk> the more <unk>
However, it's a terrible memory.
I can't remember if I forgot my <unk> but it reminds the year where it came up every percent of the songs of my <unk> conversations that we put up when I had four years ago they will be able to be able to go back in my arm for the first case of the <unk> and the birthday <unk>
It doesn't look like it.
But most people are not <unk>
And in fact, because your minds is not <unk> the concept of society, often are <unk> and <unk>
But what happened to my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if I was the case, although I didn't know it in the case, but it just could just mean a thing: they were <unk> <unk> and dangerous.
Now, for the least familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain brain that affects social communication to learning and sometimes the skills of it.
In every individual in every single individual <unk> in there that <unk> is so different to memes.
And in all of the world, every 20 minutes, you have a new case of autism, and though it is one of the disorders of the development that most fast it is not no cause <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I didn't remember one day without it.
I had only three years when my brother came into the world, and I was very excited about having a new being in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies and in fact, it wasn't really interested in me at all.
<unk> and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I was pleasure in the smallest things like putting cars in the row around the room, and we look at the machine and eat anything that would have to be <unk>
As I put it more different -- and the differences they were doing more <unk>
But beyond the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> had something really <unk> a <unk> nature and <unk> a boy who saw the world without a human being that had never <unk>
<unk>
I can't recognize that has been some difficult moments in my family moments in which I would have to know that they were just like me.
But I look at the things that have taught me about the <unk> the communication and the love, and I realize that are things that I don't want to be able to change the normal.
<unk> goes through the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any is wrong.
It just means that there's a different view of what's right.
If I could take it a single thing to <unk> and <unk> and you would be that they don't have to be normal.
And you can be funny.
Because, <unk> or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> each of us has a gift in its inside and some of us have a gift in its inside and some of the <unk> is the last <unk>
The opportunity for the <unk> the progress and climate change in the moment we try to be as the others.
<unk> I don't tell you that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I felt a little bit that it must have been <unk> in the middle of the <unk>
June House asked me to me, a teacher of communications, that would give me a <unk> kind of communication of engineering.
I was told   <unk> <unk> <unk> of these students with their great minds their big minds and their big and <unk> words.
But at the end of those <unk> I felt what <unk> had been used to have sense when I went through the hole of the flu and saw the door of a new world.
I felt like I felt when I had those conversations with the students -- I would write the ideas that they were working and wanted some of them to be a wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a big communication.
We need a great communication of our scientists and engineers with the end of changing the world.
Our scientists and engineers are where our greatest challenges from energy to the environment and care of health, and if we don't know it, we don't understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists have these properties.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers don't tell us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and <unk> please <unk> <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure we can see that their science is <unk> and that engineering is <unk>
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant for us.
We don't tell you just to study the <unk> but that we study the <unk> that are the structure of our bones because it's important to understand and try to understand it.
And when they're doing their science, care with <unk>
<unk> is a sign for our understanding of their ideas.
<unk> can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> <unk> is not the same thing that they do work.
The contrary, as he said that everything is as easy as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without the ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples of stories, and there are ways and <unk> with its content.
And at the present your work, I think of <unk>
They have asked why you call it <unk>  What do you do the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> his presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just <unk> but it goes too much in the area of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> of example, <unk> is a lot more effective shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that really inspired the only of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a very simple, <unk> that the audience can understand if you lost a little bit, and then they provide <unk> that <unk> our other senses, and you think a more profound sense of understanding what it was <unk>
I think these are just some key that you can help them open the door and look at the country that is the science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when they have been able to build this <unk> by all of the <unk> <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from the entire English English is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor <unk> from the 19th century, which is the <unk> a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that you look for a football audience without matter or beginning, and that, when you do it for the <unk> use of a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I don't have no idea what it means <unk>
Something you see with the words, I guess.
It's very important that the words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to test the language.
It was not <unk> for example, <unk> that the International Space allowed the <unk> the best words that they said in the <unk>
And all of this was because of the <unk> of a guy with the <unk> <unk> who was <unk> who was <unk>
And they put it into the Library of London and I was <unk> but it had enough enough to build them, and at the end of the end, it had to be popular in London and the end of the end of the end of London that <unk>
And just a few years later we had the first use of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most thinks it's <unk>
It's not what it is. It's the one of the freedom of the creative people.
But to show you really how the words and the policy, I want to go back to the United States, just after <unk>
So they had to take the question of how to call George Washington, your leader.
I don't know it.
How do we fix the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were made all kinds of suggestions you might have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and each other <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> <unk> <unk>
They don't really <unk>
Some of you just wanted to call it <unk>
I thought it was <unk>
And not even with that they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be <unk> by a <unk>
And I could be <unk>
All the world is <unk> because this debate is <unk> for three weeks ago.
I took the age of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
And what he took the <unk> and the <unk> was that the <unk> House was in the <unk>
The <unk> House didn't want to Washington, it was <unk>
I didn't want to call you the King if you do it or her <unk>
So I wanted to give the most <unk> <unk> more <unk> and more than it was happened.
And that title was <unk>
And we didn't have the fact that we didn't have been there that there was there before, but it was just <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a second.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was <unk> <unk> of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it really was a <unk>
And that's why the <unk> is <unk>
They said, <unk> we can't call <unk>
"This guy has to hear that <unk> and meet <unk> <unk>
"And who do you take to a serious title and <unk> like President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of <unk> <unk> <unk>
We can learn three different things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite until where I've been able to figure out the company, it has never been <unk> <unk> <unk>
The President Barack Obama has lucky to keep there, waiting for the <unk>
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that as a government is <unk>   <unk> possible to move to <unk> years else.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most importantly, and this is the most importantly, and this is what the title of President of the United States, it doesn't sound in all as far today, right?
On all if you have more of 5,000 and nuclear government -- the greatest economy of the world and a half of the air vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story have gotten to the title of <unk>
So at the end won the <unk>
They got his title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the <unk> the <unk> <unk> -- well, it was a bunch of then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound as the guy that has 5,000 and a gene and so on.
So, at the end of the end, he won and the House House -- because no one is going to feel <unk> when you tell you that now are the President of <unk>
And I think that is the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to be <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use the words to give and control the reality, but it really really changes much more the words that they can change reality.
Thank you very much.
I am 45 to meters under land in a private <unk>
The air is <unk> and it is hard to breathe.
I feel <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk to me, but about all, that <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and rocks <unk> with tools.
As the other, I have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the head with this <unk> <unk> and I just can barely distinguish the <unk> <unk> that you have the walls of that hole that are the walls of that hole -- that is hundreds of feet in the land.
And I was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days before, who lost the control and took a few feet in that way.
As I talk about you today, these men are in the profound of that particular hole and their lives with not reward and often, dying.
I went from that hole and I went to home but they might never make it because they're <unk>
In the last 28 years I was in the last 28 years in the last 28 years, in the last 28 countries, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>
From all the incredible people that I met there was when I met a <unk> of <unk> the <unk> a NGO that is going to test the modern crisis.
We started talking about slavery and really, I began to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not to grade.
When we ended up to talk about I felt very uncomfortable -- I was <unk> <unk> this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how much people don't know.
I made me a <unk> <unk> and weeks later, he flew to Los Angeles to know the director of <unk> the <unk> and it takes my help.
So I started my journey to human Sweden.
I had been in many of these places.
Some of the fact that my second home.
But this time, <unk> <unk>
A <unk> <unk> which is now there are now more than 27 million people <unk> in the world.
It's the twice of the number of Africans for all of the <unk>
About 150 years ago, the cost of a <unk> <unk> was about three times the <unk> <unk>
The equivalent to a few <unk> 50 places.
However, today you can change the entire families for generations for <unk> <unk>
LT: we find the losing it takes a lot of over 13 billion a year in the world.
A lot of have been <unk> with <unk> from good education, and the best work to then discover that they're forced to work without <unk> in threat of violence and they can't care it.
Today, the slavery works in the <unk> the goods produced by <unk> they have <unk> but those are they make them are <unk>
<unk> exists in almost all the world and yet it's illegal everywhere.
In India and <unk> I met <unk>
This strange one, and <unk> was like to get the ancient Egypt or <unk> <unk>
<unk> in a <unk> temperature of <unk> men, who women, children in fact, local families in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in their head, until 18 at the time, and they take them to the time, and they take them out of the <unk> <unk> who are in hundreds of feet.
<unk> by the <unk> and the <unk> they work in silence, doing this task and again for 16 -- 17 hours a day.
There was no <unk> to eat and <unk> and the <unk> <unk> I did that I was just pretty <unk>
As <unk> they were the heat and the dust that my camera became too cold, and I left them to work.
Every 20 minutes I had to take the car to clean the car and make the team and make it working with air conditioning to <unk> and sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
On the <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> I was going to go back and he said, "You know, I was going to be <unk> I don't know it. You don't do it.
And he explained to me very clearly that to prove emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not only for me but for them.
I could not give you any help.
I couldn't give you money, anything.
I was not <unk> of that country.
It could put them in a worst situation that they already were.
I had to trust the <unk> the <unk> and working within the system of their <unk> and they would be able to make it <unk>
In terms of me, I got to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the meantime, I found kids with rocks for miles for <unk> <unk> until they were going to be down.
Those great <unk> were more worried that the kids who are <unk> and the kids are going to go into their head with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some of you don't even know that they're <unk> -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours at the day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They don't have nothing with it.
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
When you hear the word companies we often think about sexual sex and because of this global consciousness that would be hard to me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been <unk>
I took me for a few <unk> <unk> which was given to this <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more good to a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the front of the <unk> are local <unk>
They have small <unk> <unk> where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and kids, some of the age seven years are forced to come to clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each <unk> is dark and <unk> <unk> for a number <unk> in the wall and divided by a <unk>
The workers often suffer sex to hands out of their properties.
On the <unk> I remember I remember a fear of <unk> <unk> and in that time, I can barely imagine what it must be inspired in that <unk>
I just had a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I didn't have <unk>
There was no windows big enough for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and because you make a matter so hard is important to be able to be able to be able to make it even the sex <unk> happens to us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture, in <unk> in <unk> and the list can be going on.
Recently, the New York Times <unk> that between 100,000 and 300 children are sold every year like sex music.
It will be on it, but we don't see.
<unk> are another activity that often associated with the hand work.
I went up to the oil villages where there was the entire families in the price of the boat.
This is a portrait of family.
The <unk> hands are from the father, the <unk> of blue and <unk> of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> the pattern in the <unk> until the <unk> is <unk>
I told me their stories.
We don't have <unk> <unk>
It will be not going to be able to be able to come out of this house some day and go to the other place where we really really give us our <unk>
It estimates that there are more than 4,000 children <unk> in the lake -- the greatest lake of the world.
When we went to take a look at a look at fast.
I saw what it seemed to be a <unk> family in a boat, two brothers -- some young kids have sense right?
<unk> <unk>
The kids are sold from their <unk> families -- and they were forced to work <unk> <unk> in these level, in the side of the <unk> despite not knowing to be able to be?
This boy has eight years.
When our boat came up was <unk> I was <unk> that his little <unk> was <unk>
I was surrounded by fear of the water.
The <unk> branches of the trees are eating in the lake <unk> and they often <unk> and <unk> and if it was forced to the water for <unk>
Many <unk>
From the fact that I always been forced to work in the lake.
Because I love her love and like all the life has been trying to <unk> <unk> is to the most young people under their own.
I met these guys at the five of the morning, when you get the last networks, but they had been working from the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of a one of the <unk>
<unk> and <unk>
And you have to point that these networks are getting over 400 kilos when they're <unk>
I want to show you to <unk>
We were <unk> in a <unk> village was <unk>
I met what I met in a shelter in the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We don't think what we can.
Who will get to be because somebody decided somebody decided to make the difference in your life?
<unk> for a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a <unk> <unk> with her <unk> and <unk> our car and it was the window.
We asked them to get it through a way of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were going to get out of the car, and he asked them to be going back to the car, and he asked them to be going quickly.
And then a signal is just <unk> and said, "This is the way, this is the way, this is the <unk>
As we started back and take the <unk> we took the <unk> that <unk> the way and after walking close to a hour we found that the way was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the <unk> team on my head as I <unk> in these water to the <unk>
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> I ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had in front of a holes that I could fit in a <unk> field and all of them were full of the <unk>
A lot of women were used to their window and while they were looking like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These are <unk> in a <unk> in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the <unk> they were <unk> in his own <unk>
I remember that I looked at your eyes <unk> <unk> since many of them had been under land for nine hours.
<unk> have to 90 feet and these people are going to get up to 90 feet and these people are going to take up to another area in which we have <unk> the ball to be able to extract the heart of the <unk>
First of the view, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if we look at more <unk> to the fact we see them to work to work and also children.
They're all victims of diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely to take this <unk> I end up like this victim of the <unk> and the <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> when they died his father his uncle took it to work with him in the <unk>
At the end of the <unk> <unk> <unk> the debt of the <unk> what the force is going to be <unk>
When I met it, I had worked in the lab, 14 years and the investment of the leg that you see here is a product of a accident in the <unk> so fast that doctors said that I should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> it has <unk> and not the way that, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Even that, he would be <unk> and <unk> and <unk> with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it is this kind of <unk> to a possibility -- which is a lot of <unk>
I want to get light on the way.
Did you know that their images would be seen for you.
I wanted to know that we are going to give you to give them all the way to help change their lives.
I think if we can see that if we can solve each other as human beings, then it makes it very hard to tolerate <unk> as the way.
And these images are not <unk> they're all of people, people like you and like me, and as I, who deserve the same and dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I don't think about these so many other people -- <unk> that I've had the great honor of you.
I hope that these images will show a force where you see in people like you, and I hope that that force is a fire and that that fire is that light is on the slavery because, without that light, the <unk> of slavery can continue to live in shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math math and there's a great problem for who the <unk> are as the <unk>
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, we try to explain what I do.
He is one of the most human activities is one of the more human.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  we will see more on.
But the <unk> takes a extraordinary training of a extraordinary training a high level and probably some amazing <unk> that you can have a genetic component that you can have a genetic component that you can have a genetic device.
Unfortunately, the disorders will be the wrong of the <unk> and the bad ability to do with my friend <unk> <unk> that, in his time, it was a <unk> <unk>
In the last years, it has a lot in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world that are <unk> and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress that we need to measure the progress that we know if you really know if you really have a cure to be when we have an objective and <unk>
But it is <unk> that for the oil and other disorders of the movement is not going to make blood and the best thing that we have is a act of 20 minutes.
There are to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of the clinical trials you can't have never done it.
And what if the patients could do it in home?
That would be a <unk> journey, what if the patients could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the <unk>
You don't need a personal one.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the clinic <unk>
So what I want to be <unk> as a way that we don't think about the way, you see, in a certain sense, at least we are <unk> as my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of <unk> <unk>
It shows somebody <unk> whereas it emits sounds to talk to you, we can imagine like the dancers of a <unk> <unk> because we have to be able to be all these organs that to produce sounds -- and we all have the genes that we have the <unk> for example.
And as the <unk> requires a extraordinary.
Let's think the time that leads to a child learning to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of the creation, <unk> as <unk> and as the disease affects the <unk> also affects the <unk>
In the <unk> <unk> you can see an example of <unk> <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech gets more <unk> and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the arts.
How do you take these bubbles on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials are both <unk>
The <unk> <unk> is not <unk> they are both used the normal infrastructure.
It's not necessary to design all a series of hospitals for it.
They are both <unk> Well, but it turns up in the voice not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They do very quickly take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They are <unk> and we all know what happens.
And when something has a cost so <unk> it comes to a massive scale.
And these are some incredible goals for <unk>
We can reduce the <unk> <unk>
I don't want to go to the clinic for the <unk>
With <unk> we could get <unk>
We could make a huge rate of low cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> to global scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So at that, to give you the first steps in that sense, we are <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk> we want to get a huge amount of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to tackle these goals.
We have local lines for a few billion people in the world.
<unk> with or without disease, you can call it on the price and leave me with a few cents. And I'm going to argue that we already have been able to get the U.S.
Thank you.   So I took them up, so <unk> taking all of these samples -- let's say you 10 people, you can say who is <unk> and who doesn't say who is <unk>
What do you get out of these <unk>
Max <unk> Yes, what happens is that during the call you have to be able to say if you have or not the disease.
<unk> You can see, some people can not <unk> it can not be <unk>
But we are going to get a very big sample of <unk> data in different places and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the factors of confusion in order to the real markers of disease.
TR: They have a <unk> <unk> in this map.
<unk> A lot more than that.
Actually, my graduate student, I have that <unk> has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works in the network of <unk> and also, what it looks at the project. We have a 99 percent ago.
TR: <unk> <unk>
<unk> of course.
TR: Thank you very much.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before Dr. 2011, I did <unk> <unk> in the city of New York.
We are <unk>
We put them on the dark, in the red and <unk> and we usually make the solar light.
We do the most perfect models -- even more <unk> the perfect skin, we make it in the entire time, but some of us are really artists to solve a lot of the time but some of us are really <unk> with a lot of years of experience and a true true for the images and the picture.
On 11 percent of 2011, I saw from my house, as the rest of the world, the <unk> events that changed in Japan.
Shortly time later, a organization where it was <unk> you know, <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the <unk> team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we can't be able to be sitting in home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks ago.
The 13 percent came to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village in the <unk> <unk> of almost 50 people -- one of the first villages affected by oil.
And the level of the water of the water of the water in the <unk> and more than three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
It is <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> and we took them to the <unk> and we let the houses ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons of tons and tons of fish fish <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were <unk> and we love it.
For weeks of weeks, the volunteers as the neighbors found things like that.
They found pictures and some of the pictures and <unk> <unk>
They all did the same.
<unk> and bring up to different places of the villages around around the <unk>
It was not until I realized that those pictures are made a huge part of the experience that that people had <unk>
As we were born from the <unk> and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they did.
At the end of my first week I started to help them in a <unk> center of the people.
It was going to give the <unk> <unk> <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And there was the <unk> and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean hand the photos.
This was exciting and I had heard the expression to think about the <unk> but it wasn't until the <unk> I think something happened.
When the pictures, I found the pictures, I found some that they had more than a few years ago they were still in the lab, I couldn't help think like <unk> how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
So that night came on Facebook, I had to come on Facebook, <unk> with some of them, and the next morning the answer was so expensive, and that I knew that we had to show you.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I was not too <unk> but where the water had gotten the face of the girl who had <unk> with a lot of accuracy and <unk>
In the other way, that girl would not have the point of it, and that would be so tragic as you have the photo <unk>
With the step of time, they got a lot more pictures -- and it gets more <unk> so I went back in Facebook, and <unk> and five days later 80 years later 80 people from 12 countries were used to help.
At the age of two weeks I had 150 people <unk>
In Japan, in Chicago, we were <unk> to <unk> a village to the northern <unk>
Once the week we used our scanner in the <unk> libraries that they had <unk> where people were going to choose their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story. It was all of the <unk> of the photos.
It could be a hour. I was a hour.
It was a few months.
This <unk> was got to draw a lot of hand using the areas, using the areas whose color and detail and the water didn't have to happen.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures would be in the water of the <unk> and it goes out of bacteria, with <unk> all that along with the step of the time I'm going to go up with the hand -- it was a important part of the project.
We can't be <unk> the photo at least that they were <unk> <unk> and had been <unk> by her <unk>
We had lucky with the <unk>
We know with the <unk> of a <unk>
It's very easy to be even more than the pictures already <unk>
As he said that one time <unk> the leader of my group is like to make a <unk>
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures had lucky to the photos.
There were started <unk> she had started to realize that the <unk> even more.
I had <unk>
Without them, the images of his own husband and their own face doesn't have been able to be able to be able to <unk> the images in a single picture and <unk> the whole picture.
When I put their pictures a lot of their story with us.
A colleagues from his husband found the pictures in a fire station, between the most far of where it used to be their house, but their colleagues <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the <unk> of close to the barriers to it.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Your kids are not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different societies.
One of them were sitting in the water.
He took a week to find all his family and know that all of them were <unk>
And the day I got to take their pictures their small son was 14 years old.
And for it, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that I could <unk> something that he could go back to look at the past that I could remember the last day that he didn't have been taken through that day in his life changed or <unk>
After six months in quantum Japan had taken up to you, <unk> hundreds of them helped them to clean up over the <unk> hand and the great <unk> -- the great majority they became the hands of their <unk> <unk>
More from 500 volunteers from all the world helped us go to 90 families hundreds of pictures completely <unk> and <unk>
For this time, we really don't spend more than a hundred teams in teams and materials, most of the <unk>
We take pictures of the same.
A picture is a picture of somebody or something, a relationship, a relationship, somebody would be.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we can be able to look at it, but the first thing that we were going to look at <unk>
In this it was the project, of a little bit of a little pieces of humanity, of humanity, from giving somebody their connection with the past.
When a picture like this is going to ask somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that you know.
This is also a huge difference in life in the <unk>
Some of them would be connected with something bigger to something, using their talent for something that is not going to be <unk> <unk>
To end me I'd like to read this email -- he sent him the day I went from Japan after the day I went from Japan after six months.
As <unk> I couldn't avoid thinking about the people and the stories we used in images.
One particular in particular, a picture with women from the grandmother in the grandmother until the small girl took me out because a picture like my family my grandmother, my mother, my mother, and my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, and my mother, and my daughter was just <unk> <unk>
In the world of the world in all the few our basic needs are <unk> right?
Thank you. 
<unk> <unk> were inspired to me, and curious with this picture that goes up a apple that goes up a apple on a exhibition of just a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times fast and see the world not to a million times a million <unk> but to a billion sides per second.
I'm going to show you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create videos in <unk> camera in movement.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> over the line of the line of the line -- or see the inside of the body of the body, and you see the inside of the <unk>
If I take a laser song, and I put it up and <unk> and <unk> in a second of the second or reason, in several <unk> create a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that <unk> that <unk> travel to the speed of light, and again, a million times more fast than a common.
If we take that car and this <unk> <unk> and <unk> in this way, how do you know these <unk> within this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --   Remember that all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times more fast so you can see the light in movement.
VM: I don't know this research --  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The <unk> our <unk> comes on the bottle with a <unk> <unk> which starts to <unk> and that, you start <unk>
Some of the light is <unk> is going to the table and we started seeing these <unk>
A lot of the <unk> they finally come into the boat, and then they sit in several directions.
As you can see, there is a air bubble that was based on the inside.
In that time, the waves will go through the table and because of the number of the top of the top you see in the bottom of the <unk> after several pictures, which is <unk>
Now, if you take a common mouse and we do it on the same distance and we see it on a small camera to about 10 billion times, how much you think that we would take them sitting to see that <unk>
A day? It's actually all a year.
It would be a very nice film,      <unk>
And what do we test with nature <unk>
You can see the waves that was <unk> from the table and the wall of the right-hand wall.
It's kind of <unk> a <unk>
It's the way that nature made a photo, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes you see a <unk>
But if you look at one time you look at it you can notice that, as the light is going to get out that as the light is <unk> <unk>
Why? Because the oil is <unk> and the light is based on their inside and it turns out after a bunch of <unk>
In the future, when this <unk> is in their phone, you're going to be able to go into the right-hand side, and you see if the <unk> is <unk> without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera in the boat.
As you know, you know, if we take a picture to low <unk> it goes very small <unk>
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the most surprised so you can barely get something of light.
And then we took that <unk> that <unk> <unk> millions of times, and we took one and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in <unk> and <unk> so interesting.
He can happen.
Other heroes can be <unk>
And if a new power of a <unk> future would be able to see after <unk>
The idea is that we could make something of light about the door.
And where we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science -- we've built it.
The left, is our <unk>
The wall of the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light in the door.
And then it was the following of our paper in <unk> <unk>
And a very small fraction of the <unk> go into the camera but interestingly, in moments different ways.
And as we have a camera that works as it works as fast our <unk> has <unk>
It has very good <unk> and you can look at the world to the speed of light.
So we know the <unk> to the door and also the black objects but we don't know what that is going to call to what about a distance.
At the end of a laser can record a picture in which you see in the screen, it really doesn't have no sense.
But we're going to take a lot of images like this, tens of images, the <unk> and we try to look at the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
We can see it in <unk>
This is our <unk>
We have things to explore this in the laboratory, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> <unk> with what's going to go back to the <unk>
or we could look for carbon conditions looking at the light to the <unk>
or we could build <unk> to see the inside of the body <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is pretty hard, so it actually is a gift to scientists so that you start to think about the <unk> as a new <unk> <unk> to solve the <unk> problems in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he became a scientist, a scientist, he became the science in art, a art of seven <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we took them every time they're not just for <unk> but we can see it.
We create a new way to photograph with <unk> <unk> and code of color.
And let's look at those tribes that the time between every one of those waves is just about <unk>
But here's something fun.
If you look look at the underneath the <unk> these are going to come out of us.
<unk> should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out that, as we are recording almost the speed of the light, we have <unk> and Einstein would be thrilled to see this image.
The order that happens in the world in the world sometimes is going to go into the camera.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A phone can be <unk> the life, and it gives you social freedom.
With a phone can <unk> a crime.
With a cell and you can feel a message and start a <unk> in Egypt.
With a phone can record a song, they can record a song, and you can be famous <unk>
All this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> <unk> and live in the city of <unk>
I'll go back to that moment to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of people <unk>
This is the fall of remembering you imagine if all these people are going to be able to take it into a change, they had a phone in the pocket.
Who of the guys have a phone here?
<unk>
Raise their mobile <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a lot of all today have a cell phone.
But today, I talk about me, from my phone and how it changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 percent of information.
<unk> in 2050.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the International Center came up a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This <unk> says that every single part of the Internet company every city of the whole Europe, has to store a wide range of information of the girls.
Who is called <unk> who would send a email to you.
Who would they send them a little bit of <unk>
And if we use the phone where we are.
All of this information is based on at least six months, and to two years ago in his company in his company or the <unk>
And in all Europe people came up, and he said, "I don't want to work.
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital was and we don't want to be the <unk> and the world's <unk> the whole information of us.
There was <unk> <unk> <unk> they all said, "I don't want to work.
And here you can see about 10 billion people who came up to the streets of <unk> and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some even said that this would be <unk>
The <unk> was the secret of Germany of 23
And I also asked me if this works.
You can store all this information about us?
Every time we use the <unk>
So I asked my <unk> <unk> <unk> that in the time was the largest company in Germany, which is all the data that they had about me.
And I asked them a time, and I went back to me and I went back to go back and I didn't have a particular response -- it was all <unk> I was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
And so I decided to be <unk> because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, no, you don't give you this information.
At the end of the end of the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for the central law of the <unk>
So I got this ugly <unk> with a <unk>
And it had this.
There are a lot of <unk> and five billion <unk> <unk> of information.
At the beginning, I said, well, it's a huge Okay. Okay.
But after a time I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this picture?
It was a little bit <unk> what should you do with that?
Because you can see where I talk about the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this data <unk>
I want to make a public thing.
Because I want to show you people what the <unk> <unk>
So, along the <unk> <unk> and I got a country -- we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of life.
You can go up and go back and go back and go back and go back.
You can see every step that I do.
And you can see how I'm going to be <unk> in train to <unk> and what often I call in the way.
All this is possible with this information.
That day a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
But all of us.
First of all, there is things like, I call my wife, and she calls me talking about a couple times.
And then you call me some friends and they call them between them.
And then you just call the other, and the other other to the other, and we ended up with this big network of it.
You can see how their people are <unk> between the way what time they call a lot of each other, what time they can.
You can see all this.
You can see the <unk> the leaders leaders.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries as China and Iran.
This is a model to study the way of your society, because you know who I'm going to talk about it, who did a email to <unk> all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is organized at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said to first, imagine if all of these people in the streets of <unk> in the end of 1989, they had a phone on the pocket.
And the <unk> had been known who went on this minute, and if the <unk> had been known who were the leaders -- this would never had to happen.
<unk> every of the Berlin <unk> maybe I had never happened.
And in a result, not the each of the <unk>
Because now we are in the day of the developing and companies and companies want to store so much information of us as it might be possible within the website.
They want to have the possibility to keep our lives and they want to get it forever.
But the <unk> and live in the digital was not a contradiction.
But today, you have to fight the <unk>
You have to fight that for a day.
When you go back to home to go back to their friends that the privacy is a value of the 21st century and it's not the past time.
When you're going to go back to your house, you go back to their competition that just because companies and the developing states can be able to make some information, they don't have to do it.
And if I don't think that you ask your English company what information are going to bring out of you.
So in the future, every time you use their solutions that you can be able to fight that you have to fight the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello, <unk> what is that?
It's not enough.
Hello, <unk> what is that?
I call me <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor I brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different different different different different <unk>
As a result, I have a brain -- so that is all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is not genetic
It's not <unk> you can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the <unk> of my mother and not the <unk> because my parents were <unk> but they are.
It's just about accidents, as the one that happened to me in the Bill
Now, I'm going to be <unk> I don't want to not want any of the right now.
I feel bad for me, because in some point of life, have been able to be <unk>
We're going to work.
<unk> <unk> are in the center of the <unk> which is going to be in <unk> and what you see it.
I was 16 places that we need to know it.
And they say, "Hey, I can be at least a little <unk>
In addition, I say, I have 99 problems, and the <unk> <unk> is just one of them.
There is a <unk> of the <unk> I would get the <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> woman, and live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm a <unk> <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same <unk>
I love that if I would like to walk from my home to New York, I was going on.
A lot of people with <unk> <unk> but my parents don't believe in the <unk> <unk>
The one of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters was going to go to the public school, my parents would go to the school system and the <unk> to the school system and the <unk> that I was also going on, and if we didn't take all the end of the end of my mom.
My father taught me to walk in the five years I put my <unk> in their feet and just it just night.
The one thing that used was a dollar in front of me for me for me for the <unk>
<unk> that I have within it was very strong and <unk>
Yeah. The first day in the front century, I was walking as a <unk> <unk> which has been a lot of <unk>
When you put it up with it only six percent in my city and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 percent, and they're still all of the family.  I think nobody realized we were not <unk>
This was before smallpox and the politicians would think that we use <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>
The people who grew up had no problems with my faith.
Yet it seemed to be a lot of a lot that you have to get out of <unk> for the <unk>
I said that I had enough fast to live three different months without eating three different months without eating -- so <unk> the <unk> is very easy.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Yes, in <unk> it's crazy.  My parents couldn't pay the physics, so I sent me to the physics, so I sent me to the medical school.
I learned to <unk> with <unk> or it's that I can walk with <unk>
I'm in New York and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used to be <unk>
And when my friends were going to go back on the summer in the coast of the world, I didn't go to me.
I was going on my focus on a war, because my parents were afraid that if you don't go to <unk> all the <unk> we were <unk>
In the summer of the summer, often my father went from <unk> so I was <unk> so I used to take them up on the table and I remember that the water is <unk> and I remember the water and I remember the water and I thought, <unk> <unk>
But the cure is <unk>
I have to say that it's very boring but before you do this -- it was a <unk> <unk> that I could not put up <unk> <unk>
And now I can <unk> in the head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything else, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in the <unk> <unk>
And I went to college through the positive race, and I got a role to the <unk> University of the State of the <unk> because I went on all the <unk>
It was like <unk> <unk>
And all of me <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart tasks of the least smart <unk> in my own, and also in their age of the age of the time.
Every time I did a picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
But I never got a paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> <unk>
It's a work of a girl with cerebral
I was a girl with cerebral
So I started walking up to the four of the four <unk> when I took a <unk>
I have <unk>
At the end of the end of the end of <unk>
Thank me God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't have the paper.  And they gave them to <unk>
I went to <unk> by the middle of the department of the theater, they sent me to me as if somebody had killed my cat, to ask why and she told me that because they think it could not do the <unk>
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the <unk> <unk> you can't do the <unk>
It was a paper for the one that literally had been born and they gave them to a restaurant, without a brain without it.
I was <unk> my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for legal babies.
When I went back to home, and my first <unk> was as extra in a <unk>
My dream made it true.
And I knew that it would be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Instead, I was there like a <unk> I don't see it more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> and it was clear for me that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They just get a single <unk>
But there were taken to the facts.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common -- they were <unk>
So I did it <unk>
In my first hand, I took a famous <unk> from New York to New York, and I never forget the face of the first <unk> that led when she was going to be high speed for the New Jersey with a room that had a brain <unk>
I worked in <unk> of all the United States, and also in the Middle East in the Middle East and without <unk>
Some people say I am the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to know the first place, but I know that you never heard that small <unk> which says that women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, <unk> <unk> and I launched the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in New York, now in its year.
Our goal was going to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media media and at the time to remind them the <unk> <unk> and <unk> are not <unk>
<unk> <unk> was much more easy to fight the challenge of <unk>
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I went to the one of the news for the news of the news of the news that has come back with Keith <unk>
I went on as if it was going to a <unk> <unk> I was going to take me to a study and I sat on a <unk>
I looked at the night and I said, <unk> can give you another <unk>
She looked at me, and he said, <unk> four, three, four.
And we were in <unk>
So I forgot to the desk of the man to be able to go into the screen for the <unk> and when I ended up was <unk>
At the end of the end of my opportunity and <unk> knew that they didn't be able to be able to get to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> turned up to <unk> but it turned up as well as a full time and <unk> my chair.
Something fun that I learned on right with Keith <unk> was that people in the Internet are <unk>
It says that the kids are <unk> but I never got me from me or <unk>
All of a sudden, my disability in the Internet became a <unk>
<unk> <unk> in the line with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk>
How does you do it?
We really should be <unk>
A guy suggested even that I would say, my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as the one.
If somebody in chair you can't make <unk> then <unk> you can't make somebody in <unk>
<unk> are <unk> Yeah, <unk> man.
The <unk> are the greatest minority of the world, and the more <unk> in the world of the environment.
The doctors who said not <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, we have grown up with the means of communication, I don't think that <unk>
I hope that together we can create a lot more effective images of disability in the media and in life.
Maybe if there were more positive images that <unk> less than <unk>
Or maybe no.
Maybe we still need all the society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led to me to be a very small places.
I came to <unk> by the red <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a film with Adam <unk> and to work with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the <unk> world has become <unk>
I was <unk> on a great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And he turned out of the <unk> children in <unk> an organization to give the family refugees a <unk> part of what my parents was <unk>
It was the only time my father looked at me in alive, and I looked at this talk to their memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call me <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can also can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a little kid of a small people.
I don't know his name, but I know the story.
It lives in a small village of <unk>
This people is about <unk>
<unk> <unk> the small people to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without nothing for him there, it's going to the great city in this case, <unk> the capital <unk>
When it comes there, there is no opportunities -- there is no work, not a work, no than future.
He has only living in a restaurant, in the city of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> anything.
A day is about a guy who gives you to take it to <unk> after <unk> to <unk>
It comes to a dynamic group of people who gives a <unk>
It gets a little bit of money that you can take her new money to send home to his family.
I came to a young.
They finally go home.
It starts a new life.
It has a personal goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky came up a year.
That boy from that little village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> <unk> and that group of people were the <unk> an terrorist organization with the <unk>
So how the story of a kid of a small village trying to make their dreams in the city end with him <unk>
He was <unk>
I was waiting for a opportunity, waiting for the future, waiting for a future, waiting for a future, and this was the first thing that I was born.
This was the first thing that we put it out of what we call the <unk>
And its story are going on in education centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young people who <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in London, that you take something beyond the <unk> of the <unk>
For the young, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the one of the city of the city -- and the young people don't live in the prosperity of their cities.
It often is the youth who are the most high rates of <unk>
For 2030, three of every five people who live in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't think of the young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't take them to communicate the story of the <unk> <unk> the door of access to violence, to violence, to the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk>
And in my city of <unk> <unk> 70 percent of the young people is <unk>
70 percent is not not going to school.
They don't make almost anything.
I went back to <unk> last month and I went to visit the <unk> <unk> the hospital where I was born.
I remember going to be at that hospital <unk> <unk> and if I never had to get it.
And if I had seen forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually in the fact that I was actually in the time to come up to a few leaders in a business force.
<unk> about 90 leaders <unk>
We sat out and we had a kind of ideas about the solutions to the great challenges that they face the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was the <unk> University.
There was no work, no opportunities.
I remember when he told me that because I was a professional university <unk> <unk> was the perfect <unk> for Al <unk> and other organizations to be <unk>
They used people as it.
But this story takes a different way.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from the point to the B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have grown up completely the <unk> system and a mouse can be the more easy to <unk>
<unk> saw a opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> <unk> in the local <unk> who usually couldn't be <unk>
I took 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is in some moment to create hundreds of <unk> for the next three years.
Why is different this story?
What do you do this is going on.
I think its ability to identify and make a new opportunity.
It's the <unk> spirit and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
<unk> people to be the <unk> opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who was a young man who went to one of my <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young young people in the bottom of the <unk> and how to be <unk> and how to create a culture of business.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years ago, and until it makes a little bit, until you put flowers to your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic sent from the <unk>
If you get it to somebody, we say, it was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
And for those who grew up for war war, the answer will be <unk>
So, I saw a opportunity.
He started a <unk> company and design design.
I created a farm in the outside of <unk> and it started to grow <unk> and <unk> that he could say, you could survive the hard <unk>
And it started the result of flowers for <unk> creating <unk> in the houses, and the companies and now it's working in the creation of the first <unk> park in 22 years.
There are no public levels in <unk>
It means to create a space where the young families, can go together, and as he says, <unk> <unk> <unk>
By the way, he didn't be <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the men, and in that room, the presence of <unk> had a really profound impact in young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for a choice, working for government, but its story, it really had a strong impact about them.
They used them to look at their city as a place.
<unk> to believe that they might be <unk> that could be <unk>
For the end of the day, they had healthy solutions for some of the biggest challenges that they face the city.
<unk> solutions for local problems.
So, let's inspire the young people and create a culture of business is really a big slide -- but the young people need capital to make their reality.
They need to experience and <unk> to <unk> in the development and put it into their business.
It takes the young people with the resources with the resources that they need, <unk> the support that they need to happen to happen to the creation, and we create a lot for global growth.
For me, the business spirit is something that start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
<unk> is not just running away.
I think it's working hope.
Your leg of the <unk> is how it calls when it is <unk> when it is it to transform the way people see their city.
<unk> <unk> children from the street to help them <unk> and to keep them to it.
He gave them the opportunity to bring out of <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a huge impact in their cities.
So my suggestion is, to turn the young people in <unk> <unk> and <unk> its <unk> innovation and you get more stories about flowers and <unk> from the <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I had about 10 years and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains of the <unk> in the New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk>
The sun did that the leaves <unk> as a <unk> and it's not going to be the way that we were all the first humans in building that land.
We got to our field.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> with a beautiful lake <unk> when I found something awful.
Knowing the <unk> there was a <unk> from about four feet with hearts from apple <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very hot.
The <unk> who were too excited like to take what they were <unk> who thought I was going to give your <unk>
That question took me with me, and you get a little bit.
Who make our <unk>
No matter like <unk> or where <unk> <unk> who make our trash in <unk>
Who make our trash in Rio or Paris, or <unk>
Here's here in New York, the Department of <unk> <unk> our percent of 11 tons of <unk> and two tons of <unk> and two tons of <unk>
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work.
What do you feel using the staircase and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I went on the trucks and walked out by her <unk> and I took them to people in office and <unk> in the entire city and I learned a lot, but it still was a <unk>
I need to get more more.
So I started working as <unk>
Now I don't just was just working in the <unk> I was <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was a wonderful privilege and a amazing man.
They all wonder about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as well like that, and in the days that it's very strong one is <unk>
It costs a lot of <unk>
I met people who had worked on that for several years and their bodies they were <unk> to the weight of getting on their body of tons of <unk> all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
I agree with the base of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is one of the ten <unk> more dangerous <unk> and I learned the reason.
You're going to go back and go into the middle of the day and they go out to you.
You just want to be <unk> so much the investment is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And also the trash in the self is full of the <unk> that often come out of the truck and they have been aware of.
I also learned about the <unk> of <unk>
When you think about the <unk> and you see a city from the top of the <unk> you can understand that the trash is as a force of nature in it.
You never leave you.
It's also like a small way of your breath or light.
It always must be in movement.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me to be a lot of <unk> because I think that the <unk> of them are the most important work in the streets of the city for three reasons.
They're the first friends of public health.
If you don't know about the <unk> and effective and effective every day, this starts to <unk> from their <unk> and their <unk> <unk> we think of them in very real ways.
So that we had been used for decades, and centuries are getting <unk> and they start <unk>
The economy.
If we can't get it out of the old we don't have space for the new of the economy that the economy are starting to failure when it's in danger the ground.
I'm not thrilled for 2030, just to take his relationship.
And then this is what I call our average speed that we can.
And that I mean, just the speed of the speed that we were going to move on the <unk>
It is not going to be able to <unk> no <unk> or we took them with us our cup of coffee, our bag of the <unk> our <unk>
We use it <unk> <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a work of work in the other side that you can know about it.
So today today I want to take a couple ways to think about the <unk> and we can help reduce the <unk> and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a <unk> city and human
Your work, I believe, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day, in the <unk>
They use a effect in many cities.
Do you know when you <unk>
And their work allows us to make us.
They're almost a way of a day.
The flow that are going to lead us to each of our own <unk> our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow has always to keep a way or another.
A day after 11 of September September I heard the <unk> from a <unk> walked on the street, I took my son on the street, and there was a little man doing her <unk> <unk> and there was a man doing her <unk> <unk>
And I tried to hear their work that day in particular, but I started crying.
And I looked at me, and I just looked at it, and he said, "Let's be okay.
Let's be <unk>
Shortly after that I started exploring the <unk> and I went to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together many times and we did good friends.
I want to believe that I was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist in this planet as a species we need to have been able to have been all the very real cost of the hand hand of the hand work.
The <unk> that we think when we talk about 2013, represent the three percent of the entire nation.
It's a very remarkable.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next thing that you see somebody who are a work is clean to you, and you get a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you very much.
And my work is <unk> in the connection to think about our community and the community of the environment where architecture is used to the conditions and local life.
Today, I took two recent projects like this.
They both are sitting in developing countries in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
And also, you share the fact that the different analysis from the different analysis from different dimensions, they become a essential part of the work the end of architecture.
The first example started with a invitation to design a training center of several stories in the capital of Ethiopia, <unk> <unk>
This is the kind of building that we showed us as example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get out of <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important issues for <unk>
In first, these buildings are almost <unk> because they have a lot very big <unk> where people can't be able to buy things.
Second, you need to take a lot of energy because the <unk> of the <unk> uses heat on the <unk> so it's necessary a lot of <unk>
In a city where this is not really going to happen because it comes from 20 to 25 degrees for 25 degrees for the whole year.
And in the third of all, it doesn't have nothing to see with Africa or in Ethiopia.
It's a worth of a <unk> place in culture and <unk>
In our first program to Ethiopia, it was really thrilled with the ancient market that is this structure to the air air where thousands of people, go and buy things all the days to small <unk>
There is also that idea of using the public space to make the public activity for it.
And so I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a private center.
But the question was how to build a <unk> building of several time, these principles.
The next challenge was introduced to the <unk> the space that is sitting in a much growth area of the city, where a great part of the buildings that now we see in the image, not exist.
And it's also between two streets that they don't communicate in a range of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, <unk> all of the <unk>
And this brings up with a <unk> <unk> which creates a space to the air air in the building that are <unk> by their own way of the sun and rain.
And around this space we've been able to consider the idea of the market with small business, which changes in every floor because of space.
I also thought, how to close the <unk>
I wanted to find a solution that <unk> the local conditions.
And I put me to think about a similar tissue to a <unk> <unk> with <unk> to allow the heart of the air, and also the light, but of a way <unk>
And then we put it into these beautiful buttons of the <unk> <unk>
They have <unk> <unk> and this helped me model <unk>
We are building that with these small pieces of <unk> which are the windows that they will go on the air and the light of a way on the building.
This is <unk> with these little <unk> <unk> that uses the light from the building to light the building for night.
With these ideas it was not going to convince the developers because I thought, "This is not a legal center -- not what they were <unk>
But in fact, we all realized that this idea of the market was a lot more more than the <unk> center because at the end of the United States had more local and <unk>
And also, the idea of the <unk> was a lot more economic -- not only because of the material in comparison with the glass, but also because it wasn't that it was not necessary to have <unk>
So we get certain ways in the order that we use to bring the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the <unk> of energy to the building in a city where we electricity is almost every day.
So we got a great advantage to put <unk> in the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of paper and <unk> that create this <unk>
And these <unk> in the roof, that in a set of water for <unk>
It's waiting for the beginning of the next year, because we're going for the fifth floor of the construction floor.
The second example is a <unk> plan and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a big project, the greatest thing that I have been together, I needed not just to understand the city of <unk> but also its environment, their tradition and culture.
For that analysis I got special attention in the <unk> a structure of a few years ago that was surrounded by a wall with <unk> doors from access to the lines of the lines of the lines of the lines of the lines of the lines of the lines of the lines of the lines of the lines of the lines of the lines of the lines of the lines
When I went to all, the first operation of design that we did was <unk> the streets that we did was able to be able to create 12 building building building in the size and features that there are in Congo, and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we took some points out in relation to the idea of the doors and the idea of the International doors with lines and this is going to understand the big model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell cell cell and the <unk> as a essential part of the TED plan.
I thought, what would be the best treatment for a apartment in the climate change.
And it's <unk> because it creates a difference between both sides of the house and so much a natural basis.
So you get a resource that that the majority of the work are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European <unk> and the city city and the city.
It has these building with <unk> and then in the sea plant we have all the connections for the <unk>
And it also responds to the local of the local values, that you have a greater star in the lower levels and a lower density in the <unk>
And I also see this idea of the city.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving the community that space changed by building it.
It's where all the neighbors, you can turn and <unk> and make a <unk> to a career of two miles by the morning, or <unk> from a building to another.
These two examples have a common approach in the design.
And also, they're in the emerging countries where you can see the cities literally will literally grow back.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people changes to communities and local economies to the same rate that grow our buildings.
For this reason, I see most important to look for architecture looking for architecture for simple solutions but <unk> that make the relationship between the community and the environment and the environment and they have as an objective to connect the nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I had eight years ago, a new girl went to our class. It was so wrong, like you see all the new girls.
I had big amounts of small hair and a small <unk> of <unk> -- it was very strong for the <unk> of the states, very good for <unk>
And I was full of the year and I was full of the <unk> until I was <unk>
And one day I took me a time after the middle of the school, I was a little late and excited in the bathroom, of girls.
When the coast was <unk> California, I went on the room of my teacher to my teacher the book of my <unk>
And then I did.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
All of the <unk>  And I was going to take the book to the <unk> but you see, some of my other friends were very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them to all of the <unk> and I put up to me with a piece of that, just by being there, I just have to be there, because of being there, I just have to be there, I just have a <unk>
I still think what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never got to me.
It's that all was <unk>
I never got to me.
But about all, I was <unk> the reason that I told me that this little little bit so good was so good to <unk>
I was <unk>
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies have to get out of them.
And also the <unk> birds are very <unk>
We know that the <unk> are the world's number one of <unk> <unk> in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the <unk> or the long sun, or the <unk>
So you know, there is that you go to the peace because the <unk> are like the lab where you have been <unk> in all of their extra ways.
In fact, I don't know if it's a theory, to say that if you didn't have a <unk> I would have no literature.
Well, you don't have to be <unk> <unk>
I don't have to be an <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
It doesn't be <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> from the high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't be <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
You don't have no <unk> I know that it is <unk> I know that <unk> has the responses for all, and in terms of the fact that it has all all of them.
This year is going to take 100 years from his work <unk> "In the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and also the most <unk> I was all that we could have to know -- and I think in <unk> we have the details <unk> right?
We think in a boy trying to break the dream.
We think in a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forget about what is that image.
We forget about the <unk> it is.
I mean, it comes from books that the <unk> <unk> said they were so excited like <unk>
I don't know how the <unk> <unk> but we think it's <unk>
Let's see why they're going to go so good together, the novel and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious as the impression that you cut up to the person, to their wish, and their <unk> are a good narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to bone, when we think what happens when we feel <unk>
And when we feel that we think we have a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to that, to make us feel bad.
It is going to change the time and audience, we know exactly what details are <unk> for <unk> right?
The <unk> they do all <unk> <unk> and that is something that <unk>
All that she makes to give me pleasure it might be able to try to try to try to try to be able to be able to try to try to treat it, maybe they're going right now.
And it starts to know the same story that story, and since then, <unk> says that every great good thing that <unk> it is in its stomach, it looks at her <unk> <unk>
There are to admit that <unk> and <unk> were <unk> <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an excitement <unk> There are <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk>
<unk> use the details.
<unk> <unk> I like the great amounts of small hair and the beautiful and small <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
It's why you see, it's so successful --  <unk> <unk> <unk> language with the <unk>
When you <unk> it is in the <unk> <unk> of soon listening behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of their <unk> then the <unk>
He says, "Look, I know that you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the <unk> of a old word or looking at a <unk>
He says, <unk> scientific research with real value
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> you see <unk> and they make it look like <unk> but in its <unk> are search of knowledge, a really brilliant truth in fact, what to <unk> <unk> the most popular reality is really going better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> these were <unk>
He says, "The woman who we need, that makes us set up with us to get it into us a range of social feelings that a lot more profound and a lot of a problem that we can <unk>
It's saying that we go to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> we choose to get us to ourselves.
And there is some other excitement that makes us <unk> this way.
There are some other excitement of us <unk> our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other excitement that would show us to look at the intensity so <unk>
I write about this more on.
A day, <unk> was looking for a young <unk> which is a very <unk> which was a <unk>
And Kevin says that there was something weird in that man, which is not <unk> in what I did their wife.
So she was <unk> all the world.
The poor creature was <unk> without any cause.
But he was looking for things that I did their wife, you don't know it <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>
Kevin says that the man was becoming the <unk> of the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good in this.
<unk> describe very good how the <unk> we do it to look at the intensity but we didn't know it.
In fact, the more <unk> we are, we are more we're going to be able to be <unk>
And for this reason, I think, <unk> are going to make us to make oil <unk> or content.
The <unk> are going to make it a completely <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about the eight years, the <unk> but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman from <unk> years of age was built to be created by having created a false <unk> in Facebook, since the who would put messages with horrible to themselves, for a year.
For a year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of her <unk> and I have to tell you that when or this, I think of <unk>
Because we're going to be?
What is a huge thing, even though <unk> creativity.
It's like <unk>
As a novel of <unk> <unk>
<unk> is a <unk>
She is a very strange character of the American literature.
It's the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that they try to do the <unk> <unk> our minds and once we are in the sphere in the realm of the <unk> the membrane that separates what you might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous solution.
Tom <unk> is <unk> or want you to get it out of your being and <unk> and it is under the floor.
It's a way.
But what do we do that? We can't take the route <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all the world, so as I wanted to do it.
It's a mistake because we live in the time of <unk>
We live in times of <unk>
And I mean, we are good citizens of social networks where <unk> is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not enough.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're all the <unk> when they're going to be a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> Street and talk about <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> thinks in <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that <unk>
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you need to <unk> <unk> you need the problem of <unk> but it doesn't.
He sounds so <unk>
<unk> you need their aid, but they <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in the every single one of the <unk>
But as they work together, something it starts to change, and eventually in "The <unk> of the Great <unk> once you <unk> <unk> <unk> all with his solution <unk> it turns out and says, "It's not <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says that there is no person in <unk> <unk> that I don't want to take your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> <unk> in history, I look like this is very sophisticated -- this is also <unk> right?
It seems to try the <unk> as a <unk> problem.
You know, in a minute, you know, in a minute, it's the opposite of <unk>
When the next minute, they're the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> it allows you to be <unk> that idea of being <unk>
It could still be so hard.
What happens if the <unk> are really a matter of just a question where we allow us to be in relationship with <unk>
Well, maybe we don't have to be <unk> from the world of the other.
We can be <unk> with it.
But I like <unk> <unk>
So as we hope that is to remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
It was just <unk> <unk>
I used the <unk> I used the <unk>
And you look at what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve great problems.
The 21 of July of the World of the World Center came up up outside the 12th of night, 11 and <unk> on the Amazon of the <unk>
I said, and <unk> they were <unk> but your presence in the Pacific surface was <unk>
The sun program was the greatest <unk> in the history of peace in the history of the U.S.
To get to the moon that NASA took about 180 billion dollars a billion billion dollars or four percent of the government.
He took a work for a lot of <unk> people and he asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and thousands of government.
<unk> people, including the <unk> <unk>
But before the <unk> program <unk> seven men went to the moon.
<unk> <unk> on his surface, of which I showed out after the death of mine -- the past year, is now the more <unk>
So why do you do?
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> kilos of old <unk> and something that the 24 <unk> then a new sense of <unk> and <unk> of our common house.
Why do you <unk> <unk> response is that they were because the British King wanted to prove the <unk> that this nation was just <unk>
But the own words of Kennedy in the University of Washington, in <unk> and we give us a better idea.
John <unk> <unk> Some of all, why is the <unk>
Why do you turn on our goal?
And you can also ask, why is the most <unk>
35 years ago, why goes on the <unk>
Why do you play <unk> against <unk>
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go back to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're very simple, but it's difficult to be hard.
Four <unk> For the <unk> I was not just a victory of the West on the top of the <unk>
In the time, the most strong emotion was the <unk> to the <unk> of the way of technology.
It was because it was great power to do it.
The exhibition on the moon happened in a long list of a long list of <unk>
The first half of the 20th century created the line of <unk> and the airplane, and the vaccine and the vaccine and the vaccine and the vaccine for it.
In half of the century, you get the <unk> and they put it out the <unk>
The technology seemed to share what I said, <unk> <unk> I called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we can't go more fast than a horse or a ship with <unk> but in America, the tail of the 250 10 miles -- you have hour.
From 1980, any human being got to the moon.
Nobody has been more fast than the <unk> of 250 10, and the <unk> talks about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that problems that we think of technology is going to be able to go to Mars, create a nuclear energy to cure cancer, or feed the global population seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk>
I had five years ago, and my mother told me that I didn't get to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I knew that this would be the last mission <unk> but it was completely sure I would go to see the colonies in Mars.
So that of all, it happened to our ability to solve problems with the <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard about the last two days here, in TED.
It seems as if we put them up and they had been <unk> and they had been <unk> with beautiful <unk> things like <unk> applications and social networks or algorithms that are going to be <unk>
There's nothing bad in most of these things.
They have <unk> and <unk> our lives.
But they don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> who have created the less sophisticated companies that <unk> in the years of the years in the years of the years of the years of the years of the years of the years of the years of the years of the years of the years of the years of the years of the years of the years of the years
Silicon Valley, says that the markets are <unk> and the incentives that the chances of risk of risk of risk <unk>
Silicon Valley, says that the investment of risk <unk> that <unk> the creation of ideas <unk> by the funding of the funding problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> <unk> what's going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the chance of risk were in its greatest point without aware about the risk, and the small <unk> business of the who could come out in 10 years.
The <unk> has always had problems to invest with information to benefit in technologies as energy, that you need a huge capital and that development is at the long time, have been never invested in the developing technologies because they don't have a dark value of the technologies because they don't have a dark value value.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and <unk>
Sometimes we choose to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would be going to go to Mars it feels a political decision that would be popular and that never happen.
We don't go to Mars because all the world thinks that there are more important things that do in Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the great problems because the political systems.
Today, less than two percent of the global consumption of energy is about energy and the solar consumption of the two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
The carbon and natural gas are more than the solar energy and wind, and oil is easier than the <unk>
We want to be able to be able to compete that you can compete in the corner.
Now, we organize entrepreneurs and economists are from agreement about political and economists are aware about how political and international programs -- the development of a <unk> energy <unk> a significant increase in research, and some kind of control control of coal.
But there is no hope in the climate political climate we will see an energy energy of the United States of the United States or international programs that we choose that <unk>
Sometimes the great problems that seemed to be <unk>
We know that since the <unk> are a result of failure in the <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that the <unk> are the policies that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
The technology can improve things like <unk> or systems for the <unk> and the systems to the <unk> and the systems of food, but there are a bad while there were bad time.
And finally, the great problems that we have a solution because we don't understand the real problem.
The president of <unk> I took the war to breast cancer, but soon we found that there are many kinds of cancer, a few of cancer, some <unk> and only in the last 10 years seems to have found it effective and <unk>
The hard problems are difficult to be hard.
It's not true that we can't solve the problems with technology.
We can be <unk> but these four elements have to be <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to solve the questions, the institutions need to support the <unk> must be really a <unk> problem.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the technology to solve great problems, it turns out with those foods.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like in World War -- there is no political <unk> which is <unk> which is the hard and dangerous, and there's not a popular set of science fiction as we can explore the solar system.
In general, I'll go to the moon it turned to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I was not even <unk>
We are not just in our present and the solutions of the future will be more hard to make it.
God knows that we don't have to have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about it, and I'm going to start <unk> <unk> ideas who have about the <unk>
They're so common that has become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first thing is a <unk> has been a huge decline of it, it's a very reasonable belief -- it's a very popular.
The second is a <unk> we should have more confidence.
And the third is a <unk> we should get to get the trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has bad <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea about the issue.
First of the <unk> why people thinks that confidence has <unk>
And if I think about the base of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I can think that you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get in others.
I don't have clear.
But I can turn up to the <unk> of view, and the <unk> of opinion are <unk> the source of the belief that confidence has <unk>
When you look at the test of opinion over time, there's no many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> about 20 years ago, mostly they are <unk> and they're still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very excited about 20 years ago they are still quite <unk> <unk>
The rest are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly about half the way.
But it is this evidence to happen?
What the test of opinion is <unk> of course, right?
What else can be <unk>
What you see is the <unk> <unk> that people are <unk> when they do certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody will tell you <unk> <unk>
<unk> in <unk>
<unk> in the teachers of <unk>
You probably <unk> by asking you to do that?
And that would be a very <unk> answer.
And you might say, when they have been hearing your question, "Well, I think in some of them you have a few -- but in other <unk>
And what is a very big.
In the end of real life, we tend to measure the confidence of <unk>
We don't think that the most confidence that we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> <unk> or kind of person, it's going to be <unk> in all the cases.
I could be able to say that I think about a certain teacher that I know to give the class of <unk> but any way to drive the <unk>
After all, I could know it wasn't a good <unk>
It could be in my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
<unk>
And if we've got those evidence in our traditional lives of the way that confidence is <unk> why we let trust all of that knowledge when we think about confidence in more <unk>
I think the <unk> are very bad tools to measure the true level of real, because they try to get the good judgment to answer to the fact of trust in something or somebody.
And second of all, what happens with the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
We think it's a <unk> goal.
It's not that the goal that I <unk>
I was <unk> to have more confidence in which it's <unk> but not what it is.
In the end, I am <unk> you don't trust what it's not wrong.
And I think that those people who <unk> their life with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> that then he went on with them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal, in this life.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> that is the right goal.
Once you say, you say, I says, yeah, that means that what it matters in the first place is not the <unk> but the trustworthiness.
It's about what is about doing a judgment about how fast are people in certain ways.
And I think to be able to make a <unk> we're forced to focus in three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that a person is <unk> in the <unk> <unk> and it's responsible and <unk> then we will have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be able to be able to trust it.
But if, by the contrary, they're not forced to trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and <unk> but not <unk> in them to take a letter to <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can make certain things, but I see that you can see their own <unk>
And I really wonder that I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and sometimes but extremely <unk>
If you do that, I still don't have <unk>
But that is what we're going to be <unk> before we get <unk>
Most is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to be.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've been able to build systems from <unk> systems for all kinds of institutions and <unk> and so that we make it more easy to the task of <unk> its luxury.
Many of those systems have had the opposite.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking about with a <unk> and he said, "Well, you know, the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> which will be <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and <unk> that the system of <unk> which is going to ensure the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard hard as the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>
You know, you all know all of you know examples of <unk>
<unk> all that for the goal.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if you get to be a lot of confidence and <unk> to the people that we are <unk> and if you try to determine the people that we are <unk> and if you try to determine if other people, people are <unk>
It's not easy. It's <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> which is not going to do it.
First of all, the task.
It will be able to rebuild the task to rebuild it, they put things to the way.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
So we can rebuild a little bit of <unk>
We can do it if they are two people, together, we try to improve the trust.
But the <unk> in the end, it's <unk> because we give them other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have been.
You've got to give you the world enough to trust you.
You've got to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, it is because you can't be <unk> by all people people, all the time.
But you also have to give you a lot of <unk> <unk> which is <unk>
How do you do that?
That makes it <unk> in all of all, it makes the common people -- the <unk> <unk>
I'll give you a simple example.
The store where I put my <unk> says that I can be <unk> without giving you to the <unk>
And I got them and show me the money, or they change it for the color that I can.
That is good <unk> in them because they were <unk>
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that is a very good test of confidence and you have trust what you're saying.
So, at the end, I think what we're going to do is not something very hard to <unk>
In what people are going to be in the relationships, and in that machine, you can determine when and how the other person is that we can be able to do it and how the other person is <unk>
Thank you.
Since the beginning of the computers we have been <unk> by reduce the separation between us and the digital information is between our material and the world of the screen in the screen that imagination can be <unk>
This investment has been <unk> every time more and more and more than this is about a <unk> the glass of a <unk> screen and the power of the computer has become moving around all.
But I asked me and if I didn't have a <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
First we created this tool that you put into the digital space so that when the strong <unk> against the screen.
The designers can be <unk> their ideas directly directly in addition, and surgeons can practice in virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool that is going to bring the barriers.
But the two hands will go still on the screen.
How do you get to the inside and interact with the digital information using all the <unk>
In the International <unk> <unk> <unk> along with my <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer, and it became a small space about the keyboard in a digital area of work.
<unk> a beautiful bombsight with <unk> cameras to detect your fingers and the face, you can see the hands of the <unk> and you can take the hands out of the <unk> space -- and you get it directly directly with the hands.
As the windows and <unk> have a place in the real space -- <unk> is so easy as a book of a <unk>
You can look at the book and come out of the <unk> and the words with the virtual sensor that there are over every single screen.
<unk> can be able to be able to make their models directly directly with hands.
In these examples, we were <unk> in the digital world.
And if you invest the papers and we make the digital information comes to us?
<unk> many of us we will have bought and I think about the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to be?
What I have here is a virtual <unk> for the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a <unk> device in your head or <unk> when the immune system comes to your body.
If we took this most exciting idea -- I thought, instead of just looking at the space in space how we can make it to be physical and we can make it to be physical and <unk>
How would be a future that?
In the Media Department of MIT with my <unk> <unk> <unk> and my <unk> <unk> <unk> we created this only <unk>
This way: <unk> <unk> as a <unk> in 3D in space in space -- which means that the computer can move the object to any place within this small space within this small space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> the gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And in order to take the object, we put it from the object, we put it from the water of the time and space that you want to say that the human movements can be <unk> and go back and have to have always in the physical world.
You can teach <unk> <unk> and distance and the famous takes from Michael <unk> you can reproduce as a physical reality that we can.
The students can use it as a tool to understand visual concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and to the difference of the <unk> or the books of <unk> this is a real experience, and you know you can play and <unk> It's very powerful.
But what's more fascinating to change the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical <unk>
As you see, the digital information is not just going to show you something that you start to act directly about us as part of the physical world that are missing us without that we have to get out of our world.
So we started the talk today today about a <unk> but if you get it on the only limit that is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to go to a school to be able to overcome the <unk>
But my mother's mother said, "No."
My parents wanted to take me in engineering, like them.
And then we can survive the Industrial Revolution -- <unk> think that there was just a way that there was just a way to <unk> a safe work and good <unk>
No matter if I work would like or not.
But my dream was going to be a <unk>
This was me, in my piano enemy.
A director of <unk> must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything that I could actually go to the school school.
Until I wrote to the director of the school and the <unk> of a radio program.
But none of the Chinese <unk> the idea.
No Chinese took me to me.
And just my friends <unk> me, but they were kids, without me like me.
So it was that at the age of 15 years ago, I knew that it was too much greater for them.
My dream was never <unk>
So you know, for the rest of my life a second class was the only thing that I could be.
And this was so wrong.
So I thought about another <unk>
No one of my story I wanted to <unk> Okay.
<unk> to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what the first books I would here?
The who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about the Chinese life.
And it's not <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth line for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your <unk>
I said, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to come out of this <unk> <unk> and to combine the relationship with my parents.
I find it with a new culture also gave my habit of reading <unk>
<unk> lots of <unk>
For instance, at the beginning of this map this map was that I thought it was what the students in China are going on.
I had to know that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map means the perspective of people.
I read you not something new.
It's a common practice in the world.
There are to fields of research as religion and literature and literature.
<unk> and <unk> give them a more profound understanding of a subject.
And I thought if I read it <unk> worked for research, why do you not do it also in the <unk> life.
So I started to read books of two.
You can be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> the <unk> are economic and <unk>
For the <unk> they're all <unk> <unk> fear and <unk> <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
For example, it's through the translation of the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books they took me a magic door to convince people in the past and the present.
I know that I didn't go to feel used or <unk>
Some of a dream is really not compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've got to believe that the wrong is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is connect with the place that they come on the dreams, where it comes to happiness.
Until a dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, I am here, happy, living back with purpose and create the most part of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client of <unk>
I was a global student in psychology in which I was a huge student in psychology in January.
She was a age of 26 years called <unk>
What I went to the first term using <unk> and a <unk> <unk> went on the <unk> of my office and he told me that I wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class of class had a <unk> like first <unk>
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I created that I could be.
But I didn't do it.
With the <unk> stories that Alex <unk> was made me easy to just move your head as a <unk>
<unk> are the new <unk> <unk> and why I show it it was right.
You start to work after a little bit later, you have children after death goes out before the death goes later.
To focus as Alex and I had long time.
But a little bit later, my <unk> would happen to go to Alex who talk about her life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, <unk> is coming up with kinds of the <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> head but it's not like it was going to marry him."
And then my camera said, "It's no, but maybe you get it on the screen.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of the talks is before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a moment <unk>
It was when I realized the <unk> aren't the new <unk>
Yes, people feel my head after what it was <unk> but this didn't did that the <unk> <unk> were a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> <unk> were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and I had a real, not only for Alex and their life life, not only to influence the families and the future the future and the future of the <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in America today.
This means about about the population of population, or 100 percent if you think that no one comes to the age without going before the <unk>
Raise your hand if they're in their <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, Yes.
If you work with <unk> I love a <unk> <unk> the dream of a <unk> I want to see.
This is not just my minds. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will go to 35 years.
This means that eight percent of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that you give them to their life to be past for when you have 30 and <unk>
People from the <unk> I didn't go to me.
This audience is going to be fine, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career you have a exponential impact on the amount of money that <unk>
We know that more than half of the Americans are <unk> or they're coming out with their partner for 30 years.
We know that the brain ended up the second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and it was <unk> for the <unk> which means that if there is something that you want to change themselves, now it's the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times for their <unk> that in any other time of life, and we know that the <unk> <unk> comes to the <unk> and things get complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment for <unk> about their body and their options.
When we think about the middle of the child, we all know that the first five years are <unk> for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment where their local life and common has a <unk> impact in the person who was <unk>
But what we don't hear with often is that there is something called the Chinese and our <unk> are a critical moment in economic development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
<unk> talk about changes in the line of the time.
The researchers call the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> names <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As the culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that is actually the decade that is actually the decade that is actually the decade that is actually the decade that is actually the decade that is actually the decade that is actually the decade that is actually the decade that is actually the decade that is actually the decade that is actually the decade that is
<unk> <unk> said to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think about when you give them to a <unk> in the head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Not anything.
And he took them to that person the sense of possible and their ambition and it's not absolutely nothing.
And then all of the days of the day, moral smart interesting interesting -- you know, or their children and they say it something like this: "I know that my <unk> is not good for me, but this relationship is not good for me, but this relationship is not going to not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Or they say, "I really tell you that as I start a career before the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of <unk> everything will be <unk>
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day I graduated from the <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My title for the <unk> were like the game of the passwords.
They all took them and <unk> but then in some time about the age about the age of the age of the age of the music and they all began to take them out of the music and they all began to go.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be able to be able to be the only thing that I was married with my husband because he was the fastest chair when I had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
I don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little <unk> but you don't know the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there is a huge pressure to the <unk> and so many of you start a career, choose to choose a city to choose a partner and have two children in a long period of time a lot of time for a long time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that you start to show you that it's much more hard to do all of one time to the <unk>
The age of the age of age <unk> is not about buying a regular cars in it.
It's about realize you can't have the career you want right now.
<unk> realize you can't have the son that you want to do now, or you can't give you a brother to your child.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room and talk about their <unk> "What was I doing?
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
And the Library of 2012, we came to my office because I was in their own words, having a design crisis.
He said, "I would like to work in art or the minute, but I still didn't know what the past years working as <unk>
As it was more cheap, living with a <unk> which showed more <unk> that we think of.
And despite being about a lot of a very hard <unk> their previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then they put it out she was just to say, "You don't take her family, but it can choose to their <unk>
Well, a day later, he took her head on their legs and <unk> during almost the whole hour.
I had just buy a new <unk> for <unk> and there was all the morning <unk> with their many <unk> but then it turned to look at the chemical space that remains after the British space that remains after the words of the words in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was about the <unk> when I saw it, and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk>
Who is going to ask me to ask me if I gives me <unk>
In that time, I was a lot of hard work and I don't say, <unk>
And what we asked it, I was not a <unk> that actually was <unk>
He needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot of since I worked with Alex as it was just sitting as a few as the <unk> <unk> <unk>
So, for the next weeks and months, I told them three things that all of the <unk> man or woman deserves to know.
First of all, I told them that we were <unk> that <unk> from the identity of the identity of the identity of identity and <unk> capital of identity.
For the capital of identity, I mean to do something that is value to their person.
Let's make something that is a investment in what you want to be later.
I didn't know the future of the <unk> race and no one knows the future of work, but I know that this: capital of identity is a heart of the identity.
So now it's the moment for the other side of the other side of the country, from that company that they want to go to it.
I'm not going to be <unk> the space <unk> I'm <unk> the space that you don't have to tell you that, by the way, it's not exploring it.
It's <unk>
I told them to bring them out that I would get jobs and I do it.
Second, I told them that <unk> tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take to you to take the airport, but the advice that they connect with friends with our own minds -- as you know what you know how to think about how to do, and where they work.
That new piece of oil that new person who will come out almost always comes out of the outside of your new circle.
The new things come out of what you call <unk> <unk> friends of their friends.
Yes, the half of the <unk> have a bad work or don't have work.
But the other half no, and the <unk> <unk> are the way of <unk> to this group.
The half of the work created was never <unk> then to know the head of your neighbor is the way to get a work not <unk>
It's not doing <unk> It's the science of how information happens.
And the last thing, it's not less important, it believed that you don't take their family, but I know their friends.
This was really true when I was <unk> but as I was <unk> it soon <unk> his family.
I told them that the time to choose their family had come.
Maybe you think the 30 is best age to bring your head and even the 25 and I agree with you.
But choose to be able to choose to the person that you live now or <unk> now when you all in Facebook, they start walking into the <unk> is not progress.
The best time to work on your marriage is before you do, and that means to be so honest in love as you're in the work.
<unk> your family must be a aware of who and what's what you want to be able to be able to work or kill time with who the <unk>
So, what happened with <unk>
Well, let's look at that <unk> and she found the <unk> of a cousin that was working in a art of art in another state.
This weak link helped me get a work there.
And that supply of work gave it a reason to leave you to <unk>
Now, five years later, it is a special special <unk>
This <unk> with a man who would use a <unk>
<unk> his new career, I love his new family, and I send me a letter that I said, "Now the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> story can sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help.
<unk> are like planes who come from the <unk> <unk> who come up to some place.
Right before the <unk> a <unk> <unk> in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, in the age of the age or the 25 or the 25 and even the <unk> a good TED TED has to have huge effects in the years or even in the past generations
So here this is my idea that you know all the <unk>
It's so simple as I learned to tell you <unk>
It's what now I have the privilege to tell the <unk> as we all the <unk> <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can't notice what they didn't know or what they didn't did.
They're giving their life today.
Thank you.
When I had 27 years ago, I left a very <unk> work in the church for a work that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach you mathematics to students in New York.
And as any teacher, they went back and <unk>
I took them with it.
When the work was <unk> <unk>
What I was called me was that the <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the ones who had a little bit of the <unk> <unk>
Some of my most smart children was not going so well.
And that put me to think.
The kind of things that you need to learn in mathematics in the Large grade, they're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for the time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that we need in education is a better understanding of the students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a <unk> perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure the best way.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you have success in school and the life depends on a lot more than the ability to learn in a quick way to learn in a quick way.
So I left the direction and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of <unk> <unk> and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the National Academy <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the <unk> National <unk> and we try to predict what the most far possible in the time.
We studied teachers <unk> working in the really difficult, <unk> what teachers are still teaching for the end of the year of school and <unk> who will be the most effective to improve the results of learning their <unk>
We met with private companies asking what of these <unk> are going to keep their <unk>
And who is going to win more money?
In all of those different different <unk> came up with an important thing as a important <unk>
And it wasn't the social intelligence.
It wasn't the good thing, the physics and the physics is not the <unk>
It was the <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to reach the very long term.
<unk> is having a <unk>
<unk> is going to remember his future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live the life as if it was a <unk> not a career to the whole way.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students, who did my <unk> <unk> and then he took around over a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that the kids with the most determination they had probably greater greater chances of <unk> even when the <unk> in every aspect that I could be able to do things like <unk> and the results of the <unk> and the results that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not just in the West of the West, or in the National Science of <unk> where the <unk> is also in school, especially for children in risk of <unk>
For me, the most exciting thing about determination is what I know about the science about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers say, "How is the determination for the <unk>
What do I have to do to teach the kids a <unk> <unk>
How do you keep them for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is,  What I know is that the talent didn't give them to the <unk>
Our data show very clearly that there are a lot of individuals who just don't go back with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the <unk> <unk> is not able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to touch the <unk>
Until the best idea that I've heard about develop the determination in children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea developed in the University of Stanford and it is the belief that the ability to learn is <unk> which can change with the side.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and you learn about the brain and it changes in response to the challenge, they're a lot more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that that is a permanent condition.
So the growth growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I end my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work that we have to get around it.
We need to take our best ideas our most important ideas and we need <unk>
We need to measure if you have been successful and we have to be willing to be willing to be willing to start all of new with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about doing our kids are more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in least like the age of a <unk> one of my most <unk> one of my most <unk> is my mother <unk> the beauty, the way and the <unk>
Since that time, I was going to take me for this incredible language.
But for a <unk> it seems to be so <unk> as the Great philosopher China.
In the last few years, I have been asking if I can take this <unk> so that you know, so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language I can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and fast to learn Chinese could be useful.
Since I had five years ago, I started learning how to draw every one of the <unk> of the <unk> in the right here.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
So we only have five minutes, it's better than we do about a more fast way and simple.
A Chinese <unk> <unk> 20 years ago.
You just need a thousand to understand the basic illusion.
The first 200 people will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature enough enough to read <unk> <unk> <unk> to understand the basic idea of the medical pages or years.
Today, we start with eight to show you how this works.
They're <unk>
You take their mouth as much as you might be able to be <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who is going to give a walk.
<unk>
If the way of the fire is a person with arms in both time, as if it was <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This symbol actually is <unk> from the way of religion -- but I like to believe that it's the other way that it works.
This is a tree.

This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> door in the old West.
I call a lot of these eight years.
They are building to make a lot more <unk>
One person.
If you walk back, that's <unk>
As he says the old said, two are <unk>
If a person touches your arms, this person is saying <unk>
The person within the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> within <unk>
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
You take a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
You take a little bit about the tree, that's a <unk>   <unk> <unk> since a tree is pretty much a pretty <unk>
Remember the <unk>
Two of them together, it looks very warm.
Three of them together, that's a lot of <unk>
Look at the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two car together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
You take the sun and the moon and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means morning, after one day and a night.
The sun comes on the horizon.
A door. You take a table within the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
You take a mouth within the door, you do questions.
<unk> has somebody in home?
This person is going to come up from a door, <unk> <unk>
The left, we have a woman.
Two women are <unk>
Three women are together, are <unk>
So we've spent for almost 30 years.
When you use this data, the first eight questions will allow them to build it.
The next group of eight characters build some of them.
So with every small <unk> will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of <unk> which is the same that you learn about a Chinese eight years.
So after knowing the <unk> we started to create <unk>
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a <unk> <unk> It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun put with <unk> because Japan is to the <unk>
So a sun along with <unk> we created Japan.
A person behind Japan, what we can.
A spiritual person.
The character to the left are two mountains one about the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in <unk> because the Chinese -- the Chinese <unk> to their political enemies on the mountains.
Today, <unk> has become <unk>
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind you that I have to leave you talk and go on the stage. Thank you.
What I think about being dad are the movies I got to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years ago, we saw the <unk> of coming together.
The film, the imagination for months.
Your favorite reaction was <unk> of course.
He gave it a good excuse to use a brilliant <unk> and take a very short deal.
But you see that film, so so many time, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
Now we live and we went to our children in a kind of industrial complex <unk> <unk>
However, the <unk> of <unk> was a event in itself.
It didn't work.
The tendency really took me 40 years later -- you know, another film whose <unk> <unk> a kid -- and a boy <unk> <unk> a girl <unk> as a <unk>
You know what I'm talking about.  Yeah.
There is a great difference between these two movies, there is a couple of big differences between the <unk> and all the movies we see today.
One is that there are very few violence in the <unk> of <unk>
The monkeys are pretty fast as the <unk>
But I think if the conclusion of <unk> it is going to do today, the <unk> would say, <unk> you're the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> to meet the <unk> <unk> by the <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing about the <unk> is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started seeing this when I did to see <unk> <unk> my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
In that time, I also had a child.
For only three years.
It wasn't invited to <unk> because it was still very small for it.
But it was the second son, and the second son, and the <unk> level had been <unk>      And so I don't think he would feel what I was going on, but I don't think he would feel what I was <unk> but <unk> <unk>
I wonder what do you do?
It would be <unk> issues and <unk>
So you have the sense that you think about the one of a Army to bring into the ground.
<unk> this with <unk> <unk>
How do you take it out of the <unk>
I was good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow <unk> Okay? And not a world of men that <unk> which is where we are.
Why are you so much a lot that we have a lot of animal capital in the movies for our kids, and so a little bit of the <unk>
There are a lot of literature about the impact of the films of the movies, in the school, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this <unk>
I know for experience that <unk> <unk> doesn't give me the way to navigate the world of adults which is <unk>  I think that in the point of the first kind of <unk> I would really expect to navigate the <unk> because it's the end of the film, right?
My quest has <unk> I have <unk>
Why are you going to go there?
I don't know what I need to do.
The films are going to focus on the <unk> and you get their <unk> and they have no time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a <unk> animal and if you're a child, you have to use a <unk>
There are a lot of exceptions, and defend the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, but the kids are not really their goal.
They make a direct job to teach the girls how to fight the <unk> but not necessarily show the kids how to fight the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our kids, so the real and <unk> as <unk> and <unk> but they don't afford to be movies of war.
Of course, the most successful most successful and the most successful most successful and a man, or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who choose a girl.
So as many of you are thinking, this year, eventually he took them <unk>
<unk> all of you.
Remember what the critical thing when it was <unk>
I can't believe that <unk> has made a film of a <unk>
It's very good. I don't let them be <unk>
Well, almost any of these movies the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not the roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and in the age of the late years, I had a conversation that had had with a friend about a friend of the <unk> of movies that they saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you need to be <unk> in the film, there is more than a <unk> character that has <unk>
So, there is that we can be <unk>
And these women talk about I know in some moment of <unk>
Their conversations are about something more than the boy who are like,  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things about it.
<unk> I have seen it, and yet I see it in the cinema that we know and we know it.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good film, <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> <unk> a idea of a consensus of what is a <unk> film of vaccines.
<unk> is not the test of <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you have seen a lot of the film, a lot of the film, where men and women are dying for the crisis.
We have a lot of <unk> of men who have very profound conversations that have very profound conversations in this <unk> and it's the big moment for one of the <unk> to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is <unk>
And so I would go in the numbers.
In 2011, the 100 movies, how many of them think they have <unk> <unk>
<unk> isn't bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women that we have been recently in the images, then it's okay.
But there is a greater number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had made.
This is what I said,
In the United States, one of every five women says that has been <unk> <unk> once in its life.
I don't think it's the <unk> <unk>
I don't think the movies for children have something to see with it.
I don't think that the videos of music or <unk> are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that because one of the things I think is that there's a great amount of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are you <unk>
What do you don't get <unk>
They are <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is <unk> to the <unk> with violence and then we collect the bears that is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of putting up to a daughter like those of you who are doing the same and this <unk> <unk> and we want to <unk>
We have tools. We have tools like <unk> <unk> and we hope that that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, virtual or <unk> we're <unk> our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the list of <unk> is a way to make something really important, and here I mean mainly to parents.
I think we have to show our children a young children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of the <unk> is changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the <unk> and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what your favorite character was his favorite character <unk> Do you know what they <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common these things.
Maybe it's not just the <unk>
I think they are a <unk>
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than us, and I love to share their knowledge with other people to bring them to their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my child.
I want more stories like that.
I want to be less stories in which I would say my <unk> <unk> and communicate just and more stories where you see their work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, to help other people to improve and be better people, like the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
In a child, living in 2030, and one of the things that I felt was looking for <unk> <unk> in the shores of <unk> because my parents told me that I give me enough enough to me.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They are <unk> and it's hard to see.
However, with time, I got to <unk>
I started seeing ways and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion to find things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And eventually when I started studying <unk> I realized that you see with my own eyes not enough.
Because, in Egypt, my little beach in Egypt, I had grown up to one of a almost <unk> miles on the <unk>
And my <unk> <unk> had grown into the size of cities.
This is really what I took me to use images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew that I had to look at another way.
I want to show you a example of how different we see the <unk>
This is a <unk> place in the front of Egypt called <unk>
And instead of the simple view, it seems to be <unk> but when we use it <unk> and we do it using <unk> <unk> <unk> the place you see like <unk>
What they're seeing is the real dangerous changes of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of building materials, and the <unk>
I want to share with you how we've used the <unk> data to find a <unk> city called <unk> <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Amazon -- the one about 4,000 years.
The place is known in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the region, there was this great renaissance of the ancient art -- the architecture and religion.
The <unk> has always known that <unk> was sitting in some place about the <unk> of the two wisdom that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but in some place within this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is huge billion <unk> <unk>
Let's take the <unk> <unk> right at the side of <unk> and as it changed with time, I moved into the time, and it took the whole city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape in a <unk>
And I have to go back to the <unk> it would be the equivalent to look for a needle in a <unk> with the <unk> eyes and using <unk>
So we use data to the NASA to do a map of NASA to make a map of the place, with very well.
We were able to see where the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area that you see within the circle here, here, we think it could be the <unk> <unk>
So we found with scientists in scientists doing jobs of <unk> you can see here.
When I say <unk> is like you take it on the sample of shows in ice, but instead of the layers of climate climate change, we look at the ice of the human.
five feet down, underneath a sheet of <unk> we found a small layer of <unk>
So this means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet -- we have a layer of <unk> from several hundred hundred years than the <unk> of the landscape -- the same time we think is <unk>
We also found jobs of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> what it shows that there was a <unk> <unk>
This might look like it's not a lot, but when we think in the most common rocks used in the <unk> of the <unk> the <unk> these are the rocks that are <unk>
And so, we have a huge layer of which that <unk> from the tumor in this place.
We also have evidence from a <unk> <unk> which shows that what has been there, was a very important.
We still don't find <unk> here, but <unk> at the place in a close future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of the <unk> technology so that they can also make big discoveries.
I want to end up with my favorite quote from the 1960s, I mean, it probably was just written in <unk> 30 years ago.
I share knowledge is the most of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that in the land.
So according to this TED -- it was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
And so that ideas really started it in mathematics, but in a lost city -- not for a long time and found from the <unk>
It doesn't make the search of <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to show you to close your eyes.
Imagine in front of the door of <unk>
I'd like to get your attention to the color of the door, to the material that it's made.
Now you get a bunch of <unk> <unk>
They are places in a <unk> career and they go on the direction to her door <unk>
I need to see this <unk>
They are <unk> they are <unk> you're going to get a lot.
And <unk> from front against the door of his house.
There are bicycles flying around all of the parts, which goes on the side, the <unk> that they end up in places <unk> <unk> the threshold of the door,
<unk> to the lobby, or what there is the other side of the door, and you look at the quality of the light.
<unk> is <unk>
So from his chair, about his chair, about a <unk>
It's a horse that you know.
You can feel their blue <unk> you can feel <unk> in your nose.
You can know the <unk> <unk> and you can spend that it's going to go on the mouth.
It goes through a side and go into their own living room.
Whether in the room, and doing it <unk> use of their imagination, you imagine <unk> <unk>
It's with <unk> <unk> <unk> about his <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The floor has been covered with a <unk> road and from the <unk> and you come back to you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Okay. Look at your eyes.
I want to tell you about a great competition that brings every city in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago like journalist <unk> <unk> I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few men and a few and a few and a few and a few and some of the different <unk>
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers <unk> just a time.
<unk> the names of tens and tens of them.
<unk> poems in only minutes.
<unk> to see who I could <unk> with greater fast the order of a <unk>
And I thought, "This is <unk>
These people need to be real, of nature.
And I started talking about some of the <unk>
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and it has one of the best <unk>
I asked him, <unk> when you realize that you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I am not a <unk>
I think I have a typical memory.
All of the ones who are sitting from this competition who have normal memory
And then we have been trained to make these <unk> weight acts of memory using a few extra techniques -- the same techniques that we used <unk> and <unk> the same techniques that we used <unk> to reinvent their <unk> and the <unk> <unk> used to memorize books <unk>
And my reaction was, How is I had no heard of this <unk>
We were born outside the room of the competition and <unk> who is a wonderful thing and <unk> although a little bit <unk> I said, <unk> you are a American journalist -- you get a American issue.
You know <unk> <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach you to <unk> <unk> how to reinvent the order in a <unk> <unk> in alive, in national national space.
That will show you the world that you can do it.
And I said, "Well, I'm not <unk> <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something wrong.
And that was the beginning of a very strange trip for me.
I ended up on the most year of the year I didn't just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what can it really work and what can it really work and what can it really work and what can it really work and what can it really work and what can it really work and what can it
I met a lot of really interesting.
This is a man called <unk>
He is <unk> so probably with the worst memory in the world.
Their memory was so bad that I had a <unk> problem is impressive.
Someone incredibly dangerous, but it was a window that lets us see what our memory is about us who we are.
In the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is <unk> <unk> on him, it was based on the paper paper -- <unk> in the film, <unk> <unk>
So we spent a afternoon, together in the public library in the late library in <unk> City, <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And at the end of it a lot of treated about memory memory is something more than 2,000 years in <unk> in <unk> and then in the United States.
And I learned a lot really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time where this idea is that this idea of having memory memory and <unk> was not a very rare thing as you can find it today.
It spent a long time, people get in their memory, in order to provide your minds.
These techniques have done possible our modern world, but we also have changed.
They have changed it, and I would say that we have changed a lot of <unk>
As you have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems that we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places in our planet where you still find people about this idea of a memory memory <unk> and <unk> is this very high competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are <unk>
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people.
A few years ago, a research group of the South University of London invited a group of memory, in the lab.
They wanted to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a brains of some <unk> <unk> or <unk> different of the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're more smart than the <unk>
He gave them a <unk> test and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting difference between the brains of the <unk> brains and the issues of the health who are <unk>
When they put them into a <unk> machine <unk> their brains as <unk> the brain as <unk> it turns out and forms of <unk> <unk> they found that in the world of memory memory parts of the brain, different parts of them.
In the effect they <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that make space and <unk>
Why? There's something that we can learn from this?
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> career in where every year, somebody with a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of them should make the day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
In his desk, in front of his desk, in front of him, there are <unk> <unk> <unk> which he is going to try to convince them in a hour, using a technique that he invented and only he was <unk>
He used a similar technique to reinvent the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
A hour. Yeah.
And while there is a great amount of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used to the end of the end of a only concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a giant paradox known as the paradox <unk> <unk> says, "I tell you two people who remember the same word. And I tell you that there is a man called <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then you say, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I put more later, and I wonder that that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> what do you do?
The person who said that your name is <unk> is a little likely to remember the same word that the person who said that their work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity to <unk> that is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the <unk> <unk> actually doesn't mean anything for you.
And with all the other memories that go on your head.
But the word, <unk> we know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk> in the hands.
It was good when they go home to work.
You probably have a <unk>
And when you look at that word for the first time, we started to put <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> in some time.
One of the greatest techniques to do this is a few years ago in Greece <unk>
It knows like <unk> <unk>
The story says this: there was a poet called <unk> who did a <unk>
They had used as a minute, because before, if I wanted to give a very good party, I didn't take a <unk> <unk> <unk>
He put it out of her <unk> <unk> his favorite poem and they <unk> and so soon it was, the room of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only every killed all of all, but they put the bodies <unk> <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were there.
And so you can't be <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> <unk> -- the only <unk> in the middle of the <unk> and I realized that with the eyes of your mind, I could see where I had been sitting in every day?
I took the family of the hand hand into the hand of your hand -- where they were their loved things to <unk>
So what I was <unk> in that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good to remember the names or numbers of the phone -- a word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and space crisis.
If you ask you that you know, the first 10 words -- the first 10 words of the story that I just talk about <unk> is very likely to be very hard to do it.
But I would read that if you ask you to know who I was sitting about the horse <unk> <unk> in its Francisco, would be able to <unk>
The idea of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to love the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the picture, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes over over 2,000 years ago, at the first architecture, of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
I mean, you have been invited to the stage of TED to give a talk and you want to do it from memory, in the same way that I had made it <unk> if they had been invited to <unk> three years ago.
What you might do is imagine that they're in the door of your house.
And to get some kind of image of a absolutely interesting image and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk>
And then you can imagine it on your house, and you see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that you remember you want to introduce his friend Ed
And then you see <unk> <unk> to remind you that anecdote that you want to say.
And then they went on the kitchen, and the fourth subject that I talk to be that strange trip that they did for a year, and they have some friends to help them to help you.
So it is like the speakers <unk> <unk> their <unk> -- not word for word, which is going to be <unk> which is a lot of <unk>
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about the <unk> and in 2030, with this kind of terms of terms of it.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> it would be like the first place in their <unk> memory.
I saw this was just real, and I took me out of full of them on it.
I went to some of these <unk> memory and I had the idea of writing something about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory of memory is a <unk> event.
Actually, it's like to see a lot of people sitting sitting together, I mean, the most exciting thing that is when somebody would be <unk>
I'm a journalist and I need to write about something.
I know that there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have to be able to happen.
I realized that if I was going to tell you this story, I need to try to take it on its place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes -- all the <unk> before sitting to see the New York Times -- just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of a ancient <unk> school in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was <unk>
I would have been known to <unk>
It was <unk> because it wasn't just to train memory.
What is actually about doing is improve every time the ability to create and imagine these images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was pretty excited about this.
This is me, using my central team of training in the memory.
It's a couple of <unk> and a couple of <unk> and a little bit of the safety of <unk> leaving the worst enemy of a memory.
I ended up back back to the same competition that had covered a year before, I had the idea that I could <unk> in a kind of <unk> experiment <unk>
I thought this could be a good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came from control.
And he won me the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's a nice power to <unk> and the numbers of the phone, and that is actually not the point.
And these are so just <unk> <unk>
Because they're based on the early principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or <unk> <unk> <unk> to benefit with a little bit about how your mind.
With often talking about people with a great memory as if it was a <unk> <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the larger level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on.
<unk> <unk> these techniques of memory, are just <unk>
In fact, they don't even be <unk>
They work because they make it <unk>
<unk> a kind of dynamic that is a kind of common attention that most of them are not <unk> by there.
But the reality is that there is no <unk>
This is how things do it <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, it's what I was <unk> the <unk> that I didn't even remember that I had a memory, I left me to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our <unk>
How much we are willing to lose what is our <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who will go to our side of the side of us, who will be so <unk> that we don't even get <unk> in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are <unk> memory memory in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person that would remember me.
Thank you.
Today I talk about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so you know, just a place of <unk>
Because it makes 30 years ago, I was <unk> I had six years old, and I lived up there in my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, since my <unk> was the president that they shared with my God!
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, had a guy who gave the living room.
And there were all the time to look at the way, so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, all of me, and every time I went to me, and I came up in a <unk> all of me to me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> and <unk>
I took that <unk> I took that <unk> I took that room and that house.
That's the architecture.

Those emotions that that is the power of architecture. Because architecture is not about math, and the architecture of the architecture. Because of those connections that we feel in the places that we feel in the places that we feel in the places that we feel in the places that we were <unk>
And it's not doubt that we feel about that way, because I would agree with the <unk> <unk>   Americans spend the 90 percent of its time under the roof.
So 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines us in ways that we don't even do it.
That makes us a little bit <unk> and very, very predictable.
So this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what they <unk> you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know what you think about this in a building building years ago for the Greeks.
This is a <unk>
It's a <unk> that use architects to create a emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection we have used this trick from a lot of time.
We use it 200 years to build <unk>
We use it in the 19th century to build art in art.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build home.
Look, these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is very, very useful because we build things is hard.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> the <unk> and governments, they always have fear of innovation, and you have to use ways that you know they will work.
So we found it with buildings like this.
It's a beautiful <unk>
It's the <unk> Library of <unk> who became in 2004, in my national city -- and you know, it has a <unk> has this kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> who leave you <unk> what they <unk> is about to communicate with this <unk> the kids and the values of creating the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to see with a library today.
And that same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, they ended up another guy that looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use the media media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to go to read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both <unk> are so completely different.
And the answer is that architecture works.
In a side of a side is the <unk> the architects that are constantly making new technologies, new solutions for the ways of life.
<unk> <unk> and we try to get it out so much of people.
And all of the white, this is <unk> you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We have to go on the other side and go back to connect with these symbols <unk>
So we do, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we start to start out of the <unk> we put it out and then over the past 300 years, we do it on the last 300 years, and of course, it is in the last 30 years, and of course it is in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago <unk> from the decade of the '70s.
The architects were <unk> with the called <unk>
It has to see it with <unk>
That can be seen it.
<unk> small <unk>
Something really really hard.
So we're going to go to the '80s, and we started to take those symbols.
<unk> the <unk>
We take those ways we know that I like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we use them to use new materials.
I love it.
We don't give it <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we turn it into <unk> that you can be able to be able to be able to be <unk> <unk>
The ways is <unk> won in <unk> and <unk>
<unk> became <unk>
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But they were the '80s, that was cool.
We all spent the time in the developed industry, we moved up to <unk> and there, in the <unk> we can create our own <unk>
Those <unk> could be going to be able to be <unk> and the <unk>
You can make a <unk> <unk>
This is what happens with <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They are <unk> because instead of creating new <unk> we have got some of other places.
I know very well, and you all know that this is not the <unk>
This is <unk>
The architects are <unk> and we start to make it <unk> the <unk>
In the age of 80 and the beginning of the '90s, we started experience with the called <unk>
<unk> the symbols of <unk> now we have with new techniques of design design for computer, and we found them with new <unk> a lot of ways that are <unk> against other forms.
This is <unk> and <unk> and it's <unk> you have completely <unk>
So, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
But then, it happened something <unk>
In 1997, the building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that it was one of these rare moments when they were <unk> and public and public and public were completely agreement about a building.
The New York Times <unk> this building <unk>
<unk> in least a hundred percent when they ended the building.
So from a sudden, all the world wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles Angeles, Chicago, Chicago, New York, <unk>
All the world wanted one, and it was everywhere.
He was our first choice.
But how is it possible to be possible that these <unk> and <unk> how it is possible to become the world in all the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them and quickly we learned that those forms of culture and <unk>
We've created a emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing did the biggest <unk> of the world.
So you all think that if they had these things, they had the culture and <unk>
This phenomenon of the new <unk> country with other architects in the city.
I went to <unk> and I went to <unk> and what happened with these few architects in the speed of the new <unk> actually started to happen with all the architecture.
Today, for example, how do you use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to come up to the next people to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a plane, a plane, you can be <unk>
<unk> technology can see in the <unk> and the end, we all are led to architecture, and the building is getting beyond their physical language.
The architecture is in all of the parts -- that means that the speed of the system finally has been made the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is going to move so fast as fast as fast is that architecture is so fast as fast as fast is that architecture is so fast.
It's not really much time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years -- and in that time, an architect can design two, 2,000 or 100 buildings -- before you know if that I designed about four years was a success or not.
Because I've never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we found with buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we didn't have no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to be going to be <unk> because we are in the basis of the biggest revolution in architecture since the invention of the <unk> of the steel of the steel or the <unk> and it's the revolution of the media.
My theory is that when you recognize the media means it starts to bring it up and more fast, until you will be in both sorts of <unk> and <unk> the difference between innovation and <unk> the difference between innovation and -- the architects, and you know the audience.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with <unk> <unk> of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up away.
We were <unk> to solve this building <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> <unk> in the state of New York.
It's a <unk> community.
But that meant that two years before you end the building, it was already part of the community. And as the drawings would look exactly the product in the fact that the whole product was the <unk> there was no ideas.
The building was going to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to get and it works in social media -- the building left to be just a building, it became just a building, it became just the images that you are not only images of a building, they're the images that you did in the building.
And as you use it to tell your story to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative and that makes it <unk> with the collective memory and to take these things that are going on.
I mean, we don't need to show us how to think about architecture.
We can tell us another other what we think about architecture, because the digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they've changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building is that the building is today, first <unk> to the Internet <unk>
<unk> <unk> with examples of innovation, what it can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> people from <unk> and tell you that there is no response to what it can be a library today.
Take part of this.
This result of solutions gives the freedom of you.
It's all different now.
The architects are already not those <unk> creatures who use words -- <unk> and <unk> and one is not a <unk> audience that you don't see something that has never seen before.
The architects can ask, and you don't leave it for architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> from a little bit of a <unk> movement is irrelevant.
In fact, we can continue to go back and find solutions to the problems that the society.
This is the end of the architecture, and it means that the buildings were going to be very different to the buildings today.
So this means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the time of a modern city.
So this means that a stadium in <unk> can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad list of <unk> <unk> in ideas that it must be a <unk>
This means that a few robots can build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for ways that are going to create.
That means that the buildings are <unk> to the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
So this means that a series of survey in <unk> Beach, Florida, you can also be able to make a <unk> or to <unk> or even you can marry the night.
This means that three architects can dream in the East East <unk> in New York, and take half a million dollars of the community around that space is not a client alone.
It means that any building is too small for innovation, as this little <unk> of <unk> and <unk> as the animals who are going to see.
Because it doesn't matter if it's a child or a robot who uses our buildings.
It doesn't matter how to build it what it matters is what do we see.
The architects don't know how to make buildings <unk> more smart and more questions.
We've been waiting for you that all you want.
And finally, we are not in the <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world because there are a lot of play.
The buildings don't just create our society, but you give them to the most <unk> and the most <unk> and the <unk> the homes where we went to our kids, and the step of the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It was just a year and I started to walk.
And what about that very interesting way of the children of a year, <unk> as if your body was getting too fast for their legs.
It's completely <unk>
And one of the things that we like to do for the moment is look at the time.
She really loved her <unk>
And it was <unk> and <unk> and it gives you the same of those <unk> <unk>
It's beautiful.
<unk> all of their friends do this and my mom realize that I used to do it. And I made me thinking, "What did I think about doing this?
How is that of suddenly we're not going to do with our <unk>
Because they don't like it.
Every month, 10 people are going to look at <unk> "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> has 13 years and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, you just want to be <unk> and <unk>
It's Sunday by night.
It's made for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little bit of fear, because, though his mom says all the time is beautiful, all the days in school, somebody said it's <unk>
Between what his mom says and what their mom would say and what their friends, or my friends -- they say, you don't know who to be?
So it makes a video of it, and it comes up in YouTube, and he asked others who please take a <unk> "I'm beautiful or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received more than 13 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> that you don't even deserve to think about them.
We talked about an normal healthy <unk> and you can take these answers in one of the stages of its life life and <unk>
Four of people are a videos like this, in their most girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today almost almost change.
They're under pressure in the line and available all the time, talking about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Never before we've been so similar to a lot of a way that we get so <unk>
As a mother said, "It's like you have a <unk>
There is just a whole market.
And the social media who go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment is always <unk> it's <unk> to our children to <unk> based on the number of <unk> that they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no division between a life in line and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real, or what it is.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is <unk> and what's <unk>
What is the most part in the life of somebody in the life of somebody in the life of somebody in the world of somebody in front of what the normal is in a country.
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of the news in the news now.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The technique of the <unk> is now a secret.
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For those who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated from women in the popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young people.
But the kids are not aware this.
And as the stars of the stars of the <unk> and <unk>
But what is the problem with all of this?
Well, we don't want to do that our children are going to grow a healthy and be <unk> individuals.
But in a good culture of the image, we are teaching our children to spend more time and free effort to their <unk> the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities their studies and other issues they start to do.
six percent of every 10 girls have been not doing something because you think you don't look at good enough enough to it.
These are not <unk>
They're the fundamental activities for its growth as human beings, and as our society and the field of the developing development.
Four percent, almost one of every three teenagers are not interested in the ice departments because they don't want to call your attention for their physical way.
One of each five people are not <unk> in all of the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the <unk> <unk> if you don't think you're going to look at good enough to you, specifically if you don't think you're the <unk> enough <unk> a little bit to the average of your friends who don't care about that as well.
And this phenomenon has been made in the United States and China, and China,
And it gives them after what they actually have these young people.
So so we have a good thing, we're talking about how you're going to know how you're really a really real.
The low <unk> on its body is <unk> <unk>
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with the age of <unk> they are going to make less physical activity -- they eat less <unk> and <unk> they are going to bring them into a <unk>
They have <unk>
They are more easily <unk> by the people who come around and they're in greater risk of depression.
And we think that is all of this why you take more <unk> as the consumption of alcohol and <unk> surgery that are <unk> surgery and <unk> surgery and <unk> surgery and <unk> and <unk>
The search of the perfect body is <unk> to the health system and our government costs thousands of millions of dollars every year.
And we don't do it.
Women who think they have to be <unk> again, if you have a lot of <unk> <unk>
The 17 percent of the women don't meet a work of work in a day where they don't feel safe with the way you see.
Think about a moment that this is making our economy.
If we were able to overcome this, what would be that <unk>
<unk> this potential is a interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, I'm talking about it, you can't take it very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there is three ways -- the first is that we have to make confidence in their own body.
We have to help our teenagers to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the rich images and build their same.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
It was very surprised when I learned that a lot of public programs <unk> without making it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program are not only to have a positive impact but also a dark impact is also a positive impact.
And the research studies show that the best programs are living in six areas -- the first is the <unk> influence and relationships.
And these six issues are points in a lot for any willing to provide a education in a body system that works.
A education is real, but you want to this problem it requires every one of us to take the <unk> in the matter and we are a better model to keep the women and girls in our own lives.
<unk> the present status of as women are seen and went into our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the scale of our politicians in <unk> <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of a <unk> <unk> depends on the fact that it's not a big beauty.
We need to begin to judge the people why they are, not as you see.
All of us can start doing this, the responsibility for the kind of images and <unk> we published in our social networks.
We can be <unk> to the <unk> people in their effort and their actions and not in its own.
And let me show you when it was the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as the government and as humans, to change our culture, so that our children are going to grow up all its person, <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have to put people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
And by making a difference in the real world, we do that they're going to go on the big screen because just we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think you see you can never have the <unk> of being those who are, or you get what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for somebody in their lives.
Who have to have to have to get in that?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk>
It might just be just the woman who is to two car car -- what it would mean for she if you were a lot of that voice <unk> in her <unk> which was <unk> by not having legs <unk> <unk> more <unk> a more <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were <unk> this and it would be able to bring them to their potential of that way.
Now the obsession of our culture with the images is <unk> to all.
But let's get it to our kids the truth.
<unk> that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them and why they do, and because of what they do, and for how they do it to do it.
<unk> to the ice in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's do each of us, the way we talk about and we compare them with other people.
And <unk> together as a community from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, they become the <unk> change of the same morning.
Let's do it.
The five group of 1990, a gentleman called <unk> <unk> I went to a hotel in Manhattan and killed the <unk> <unk> <unk> the leader of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but it was <unk> by the other sides in the company of each of the other <unk> in the company of the other, including <unk> <unk> and the United States of the United Nations.
<unk> those <unk> <unk> <unk>
Less at the World Trade Center was not able to use it.
More late <unk> would be convicted for their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in short, Pennsylvania, in 1983, you might be a <unk> engineer, with a <unk> mother member of high school, the two made all the possible to give me a happy.
Just when I had seven years ago, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of <unk> that very much, even the majority of them are going to be able to know the majority of them, they get to us.
And so I saw that when people take time for <unk> you don't need a lot for a lot to get the same things in life.
However, in the whole religion, in the whole group of human group there is always a small fraction of people who are going to be able to use all the media that you think there is to use all the media as we all lived as them.
A few months before I took them with me and explained to me that in the last end of the week, he came up and told me that in the last end of the week, he and some friends, they had been going to training in South Long 
He told me that I would go on the next day.
We got to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> that, without knowing our group, I was <unk> by the FBI.
When I had been <unk> my father helped me to support the <unk> in the shoulder and explained to me how to make the goal to about 30 feet.
And that day, with the last bullet that he took up to the small light light on the goal and to surprise about all, especially the idea of all, especially the goal is going to grow it on it.
My uncle turned into the other and in America, he said, <unk> <unk>
As a father, as well.
All of all, the comment took a lot of <unk> but just a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
You see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those more late people would be able to put a <unk> with 700 kilos of <unk> in the United Trade Center -- the explosion that killed six people and <unk> to other <unk>
I showed those men.
The called <unk> that means right?
When I went on, I was already moved up 20 times. That instability for my childhood didn't allow me to make a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to somebody already was time and go into another city.
As I always was the new face of the class with often <unk>
<unk> <unk> my identity to help be the white but to be the new of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent in home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't developed social skills to say, <unk> <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
I said, "You know, you know the people, with the base of the <unk> <unk> as your race or their religion.
So, how could I open the moon.
One of the first experiences that they put in the test of my way to think, was for the <unk> instead of 2000.
In a <unk> program where I went on in the National <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of the <unk> violence -- as I had been <unk> almost my life, it was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from these <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I found that one of the kids who had done <unk> it was free.
It took several days to come to the light this detail and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud to be able to overcome the barrier that all the life was made me thought was <unk>
Another critical moment came up when I got a summer of summer in Bush <unk> a <unk>
I found it with people from all kinds of beliefs and oil -- that experience turned out now in the development of my own.
The whole life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and by <unk> all the people were bad <unk>
So I had the opportunity to work with medical actors there, and I could see that several of them were the most exciting and less programs that had seen in life.
It had been <unk> <unk> I developed a sense of empathy to suffering from the others. But it was not easy to me to try to ask people in the way as I would have to be <unk>
For that feeling I could just be able to be able to be able to be able to be a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how to be <unk> but I know what it's being made for something beyond my control.
Then he came up the <unk> <unk>
All of the <unk> Chinese, he did me be <unk> <unk> about my <unk> and I used to see that the race of people, religion or religion or <unk> they don't have nothing to see with <unk>
In a lot of ways he became my <unk> <unk> in a moment where I was <unk>
In particular, the inspiration can come out of the evidence and that a man was had a better influence in my life that my own father, <unk> was not in <unk>
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my mother to think, and she told me something that will be in my heart for always, as it's alive.
She looked at me with the arm of somebody who has had been enough with <unk> <unk> and said, "I'm <unk> <unk>
In that time, I realized how much an negative power you need to keep all of that <unk>
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why do I decided to go back and put it into a possible place.
Well, it's simple.
I made it because I hope you know, some day, which is going to take violence, I can hear violence, I can hear my violence, and understand that there's a best way to ask me to this white ideology and <unk> I didn't get a <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight religion and against them.
I do it for the <unk> victims and all of their kids love and the loss that religion has been produced in their lives.
For the victims of the <unk> <unk> against those acts without sense, like <unk> the actions of my father.
With this <unk> I put up here as the test of violence is not to be a religion or -- which the children don't have to keep the rest of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
In this moment there is a film that is a film that is going on your minds.
It's an amazing <unk>
It's in 3D and it has sound <unk> from what you hear and you see right right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> <unk>
It looks like your body, your pain, your <unk>
It has emotions, and happiness.
It has food as a few moments of your childhood who are sitting to your eyes.
And it has constantly a <unk> voice in your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the film are you who experience all of the <unk>
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the mind and the world.
The consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the existence of being human.
Every one of us is wrong.
We all have a normal film, you know you, and you.
There is nothing that <unk>
So I know that I have a normal consciousness,
I don't have sure you will be aware of.
The consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we didn't know anything in our lives to have sense or value.
But at the same time is the greatest phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why have these movies <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we had to produce results without experience the film, <unk>
In this time, nobody knows these questions.
I saw that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some different ideas.
Some people say that is impossible a science of consciousness.
The science, for nature, is an objective one.
The consciousness, for nature, it's <unk>
So you can't have a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century and <unk> that vision.
The psychology studied the behavior of <unk> neuroscience was a <unk> brain -- but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began had a lot of scientists on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, all began to change.
<unk> like Francis and physics like Roger <unk> they said, <unk> is the moment for the science that the science is <unk>
And since then, there was a real <unk> a <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was cool.
But it also has a fundamental limitations to the time.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the search of <unk> sitting between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic job that I had said <unk> <unk> a few minutes.
Now we really understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience or feel pain or feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science problem.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of important experiences but we don't know why.
I would like to explain to saying that this kind of work of neuroscience responds a few questions that we want to explain the consciousness -- the questions that we do certain areas of the brain and what they do is <unk>
But in a sense, those are the problems.
<unk> <unk>
Now, there's no simple problems with consciousness.
Well, you don't think the true mystery of this <unk> why all the physical process is why all the physical process has to be <unk> by the <unk>
Why is a <unk> film <unk>
In this time, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's give you a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to turn up in another phenomenon we look like the <unk> as the <unk> as the life, and we're going to find explanation.
<unk> <unk> are all cases of basic behavior how do you solve the <unk> how the <unk> <unk> how the <unk> is <unk> and <unk> the living organisms are all questions about how a goal.
That might apply to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the brain of the human brain like a phenomenon <unk> how we do it <unk> how we do it <unk> how we do <unk> all are questions about behavior.
But when it's about consciousness, the questions about the behavior are between the complex problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it's all the behavior is <unk> from a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of Congo actually still don't have to say.
I am a <unk> scientific
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that work for a long time, my head against the wall for a wall looking for a theory of consciousness in <unk> terms that work.
But at the end of the end I came to the conclusion that I didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we would think about this point.
So we have a very amazing chain, we have a very incredibly amazing chain -- and you know, the physics explains the chemistry, the chemistry explains the biology, the biology explains the biology, and the biology explains that the biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to make this <unk>
On a side, it's a fact that we're aware of.
On another, we don't know how to combine that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think the consciousness, now is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our vision of the world, but we don't know it still how.
So with a bird like this, you can need to be able to figure out ideas that we need ideas that we need to be able to be able to be able to be able to deal with consciousness from a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those ideas.
My friend Dan <unk> which is here today, it has one.
Your idea is that there is not a hard problem for consciousness.
This is all the idea of the human film, it has a kind of illusion or something?
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain the <unk> <unk> the behaviors of the brain. And so they actually studied everything you need to be?
Well, more power for it.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of political consciousness, based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for a lot of each other, that vision is pretty fast to just recognize that the observation of consciousness is.
But I'm going in a different direction.
And in the time I said, I want to explore two ideas a wonderful ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is wrong.
The physics to sometimes take some aspects of the universe like <unk> space and time and mass.
<unk> laws that <unk> the <unk> as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics of quantum mechanics,
And these laws and fundamental properties don't show you in terms of any more languages.
At the contrary, you think <unk> and that is built the world.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, I discovered that you can't explain the negative phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts in terms of fundamental concepts of the fundamental concepts of the <unk> -- and <unk> <unk> the electric laws as a fundamental concept that those laws are <unk>
I think that is the situation where we found with consciousness.
If you can't explain the consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- and time, it's <unk> then by the question of logic there is that it was a <unk>
The most natural thing would be <unk> the same as something fundamental is a fundamental <unk>
This doesn't mean that suddenly it doesn't mean that suddenly is not a common object.
But it opens the way to be <unk>
So what we need to study is to study the fundamental laws that affects consciousness, the laws that they fight consciousness with other concepts -- the space -- the time, the time, the time, the time, the same of the time.
The physics to say that we want to do that we want to be very simple laws that we can make it in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find the fundamental laws that we can make it in a job.
We still don't know what the laws are, but that's what you see.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
So this vision is going to be called <unk> <unk> <unk> by all, the system is aware -- not just the humans, the <unk> you can have even the humans, the <unk> and even the microbes and even the microbes of autism -- the <unk>
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that they are smart or <unk>
It is not that a <unk> can be filled with <unk> when you think they will always go to the speed of light.
I never can look at the <unk>
No, no.
But the thinking is that perhaps the <unk> you can have some kind of feeling <unk> <unk> some <unk> <unk>
This can sound a little crazy for you.
How somebody thought is so <unk>
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is something wrong.
If it's fundamental as space and the <unk> is natural <unk> that you can also be made as well as the others.
It's also worth the notice that even though the idea seems to be <unk> it's much less for the people of different different different languages.
A more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful laws to find the fundamental laws that we are <unk> the thinking with the physical process is <unk> the consciousness with information.
There's always aware of information, there's consciousness.
<unk> <unk> <unk> as in a human being, a complex thing.
<unk> of simple information, consciousness is.
Something really exciting is that in the recent years, a <unk> <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed <unk> with <unk>
It has a kind of mathematical math of information, which is called <unk> which is the one of information based on a system.
And they are supposed to see with consciousness.
So in a human brain is an incredible degree of integration of information, a high <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a single degree of existence of information, as well as well as a pretty similar than a pretty important.
But when it comes to the <unk> microbes, the <unk> <unk>
<unk> level of information is <unk> but it's not zero either.
In the theory, theory, there is still a different awareness of a different difference.
It made it a fundamental law of the <unk> at the top of the <unk> high degree of consciousness.
In addition, another reason is that the <unk> can help us integrate the consciousness to the physical world.
The physical and philosophers are often looked at the physics is incredibly popular.
It is the structure of the reality using a lot of <unk> but it doesn't talk about the reality that goes down.
As he explains Dr. <unk> where is the fire of the <unk>
Since the vision of the physical vision can leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what the physics do basically basically describe the flow of consciousness.
And to this vision, the consciousness is that I put it into the <unk>
In that vision, the consciousness is not in the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's there in the center.
This vision, I believe, the <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social consequences and <unk>
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I didn't have to eat anything that I had consciousness, then it must be <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you show that vision, you have a lot of <unk>
I think that I think, well, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what it matters in terms of <unk> and <unk> <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and its complexity.
It's also natural to ask consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What is about the artificial intelligence system, in the film, <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of the <unk> information that it has a mental information that the answer is yes, if it's wrong.
If this is right -- you have a lot of <unk> problems about the football systems of the developing systems of public systems, and the <unk> <unk>
Finally, you can ask the consciousness of the <unk> <unk> the planet.
Canada has their own <unk>
Or a more local level, a group associated like the audience in a TED talk, in this moment we have a collective consciousness in a TED talk, in this point, we have a real consciousness for this whole whole group of TED movies from every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question that has to take it seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a real view and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually more sure about the first optimistic idea that consciousness is something fundamental than the second of the second than the second than the second of the second than the second of the second than the second of the second than the second of the second than the second of the second than the second of the second than the second of the second than the second of the
The vision takes a lot of questions, it takes a lot of challenges, like, how those pieces of thinking is to make the kind of complex consciousness that we know and we love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going to go on the right way to a theory of consciousness,
If no, well, you probably this is the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve the night to the morning.
But I think we finally go to be going to look at it.
To understand consciousness is the real issue, I believe, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea right right.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small village in all.
I had a very normal <unk> a very normal <unk>
I went to school, I went to school, I was going to go up with my friends, I was going to go up with my father away.
Everything was very normal.
And when I had 15 years ago, a member of my community came to my parents because I wanted to get it for a glass of the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's really simple, but there's a problem.
She actually has actually no <unk>  And they had right.
I went to school, I had good 400 after school, I had a clip in the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the series of <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know it.
But they had right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be seen as a trick if we take the disability outside the equation.
It was more later, there in the second part of the teaching in a high school school of <unk> so just after 20 minutes in the class 11 studies -- a guy came up and said, "Hey, when you get your <unk>
And I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law <unk> for about 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, you know, your speech <unk>
When the people in the <unk> of the <unk> talk about things <unk>
"Why are it in the classroom of <unk>
And it was then when I gave me, this boy had had a lot with people with disability and <unk> objects.
And we don't know what we are, and it's not what some of us.
For us, the people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We are there to be there.
And in fact, I'm in this stage, <unk> what I do in this chair and probably you are waiting for you to be <unk> Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you've got to tell us that you've got to get them on a relationship to life.
Yes, we have sold the lie that disability is something <unk> <unk>
It's a bad thing and live with a disability makes you think about it.
It's not a bad thing and you don't get to make it a lot.
And in the last years, we have been able to be able to get all this right through the media of social media.
It's possible to have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk>
Or this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is just a couple of examples, but there's a great amount of them.
It can be seen one, you have seen one of the little little hands with a pencil on the mouth.
It can have seen a boy who took with legs <unk> of carbon.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call inspiration <unk>
And we use the term <unk> <unk> because you get a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, I was going to be able to be able to be able to benefit out of the <unk> people.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and thinking, "Well, for very bad that is my life, could be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that <unk>
I've lost the beginning of the number of times I have been excited about strange <unk> to express that you think that I am a lot of a <unk> or a source source and this is going to happen before my work had a audience.
It was like if I was going to go through the morning and remember my own name,  And this is <unk>
And these images, those images, those images are <unk> people with planning people in the <unk> people.
They're where you can see it and think that things are not as bad for you, or to put their passwords in perspective.
And life as a lot is really hard to be really difficult.
It would be some things.
But the things that we use, aren't the things that you can think.
They're not similar to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> <unk> because I'm going to take me to the called the social model that we are more used because of society where we live that because of our bodies or <unk>
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with it.
And the things that I need to do, and I've learned to take the best of their ability as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures too.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're just using their bodies making the best of their ability.
So, it's really just <unk> in the way we do, to share those <unk>
When people are, you are a source of <unk> it says like a secret.
And what happens.
It's going to cause the <unk> because they have been sold this very much that disability makes us a lot.
And it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> <unk> and you say, "Oh God, <unk> God, you're not going to be used by <unk>
And actually, I know I do.
<unk> of other people with disability in all time.
However, I don't know that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> which is about a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to bring the things that you go on --  <unk> the quick trick of how to take the battery of the phone and the phone of the cell phone in the battery of the <unk>
Okay.
We learn from the force and resistance of the other, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really think that you have been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that is a lot of is because it's not true, because of the social model.
A lot of <unk> to a <unk> <unk> has never done that it's going to become a <unk>
<unk>    <unk> to a television screen I'm not going to do the <unk> for the <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a <unk> and <unk> a positive attitude to all those books in <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where the disability is not <unk> but <unk>
I want to live where a little bit of 15 years ago, sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> is not <unk> not <unk> of nothing to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that are <unk> by the bed and remember our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we changed the <unk> of the people with <unk> and I want to live in a world where a kid of 11 percent in a high school school in a high school of <unk> is not a little bit like that his new teacher is a user machine <unk>
The disability is not going to be <unk> but question what you think about what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the wisdom and the football football with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, we just answer one of those questions, so please don't be <unk>
When people think of really <unk> thinks in <unk> <unk> and in Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but the reality religion is not science.
<unk> reality is something that happens in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to figure out because the fact that we actually change our lives as much as the Internet and cell cell phones and cell phones and cell cell phones.
So how do we get to really <unk>
The first step, is what I was <unk> the Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that the Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see what I see.
I'll allow them to experience what is being a professional <unk> in the field.
Now the only way to be in the field is that I try to be <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a place that you get <unk> with their imagination.
We can use the Google Ford underneath a <unk> and knowing what it's going to go through the game of the game to 160 <unk> the blood <unk>
We can know that you feel that a man of 110 pounds will be <unk> trying to <unk> with all its own.
I've been there and I assure you that it's not quite nice.
<unk> some videos to show you what is to use the Google <unk> under <unk> and give you a idea of it.
Unfortunately, it's not the images of the <unk> <unk> because the idea of the <unk> technology is a thumb when we do what we can.
So let's take a video.
Chris <unk>
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
<unk>
Chris <unk>
You can have given all people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> seven, <unk> <unk>
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the feeling to be in the field, but it doesn't have nothing to see with <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, to be their favorite players and they have asked me in YouTube and in <unk> you can see from the angle of a <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how we get it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that you don't need a lot of you know.
<unk> <unk> has been described as the <unk> reality of the most effective reality and it's not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to teach you about this video.
Man: Okay.
No, no, no. I don't want to keep <unk>
Oh, my God!
<unk> That is the experience of a man in a <unk> <unk> for his life.
What would be the experience of a little bit when you get a little bit of the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the line, the arm before the arm was before the arm before <unk> and make a <unk> what is the experience of a <unk>
And when you can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> the ball on the bottom of the <unk> or <unk> doing a <unk>
What would be their experience when you get out of a mountain to over 100 miles like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe you get <unk> <unk> <unk>
But this is not still <unk>
It's just <unk> <unk>
How do we do it <unk> <unk>
<unk> the obvious reality when the <unk> <unk> and you get the information that people want to see and say, "How we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they will always use technology for it.
I like to give you money.
So I've got here a brief set of technology in the <unk>
In 1900, the <unk> <unk> they put up a <unk> to her <unk> <unk> to the field to get more fast.
They had the <unk> <unk>
Other teams decided <unk>
More people saw the <unk> because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, I put it up in 1994, I put up in the <unk> of the field of the field and after the <unk>
They had more <unk> because it was more fast, more better.
In <unk> imagine that it's a player coming back to his group and you see his next <unk> in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that they take it on, you can't have to worry about forget a <unk>
It or <unk> the strategy.
They just come into the field and <unk>
And the Internet, you want to be because if you don't get their <unk> they lose <unk> and they don't try to lose <unk>
If you lose <unk> you get <unk>
And they don't want that.
But the reality reality is not just a <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to test information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the <unk>
How do you do?
Well, a very simple choice would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people who is down.
You can also get information from the sensors of the <unk> and the <unk> something that is working on.
And all of that information is <unk>
The good teams knows <unk>
And the bad people will get from information.
This is <unk> to the good teams of bad.
So your business team will be so important as your <unk> and the analysis of data to leave to be just for it.
I will be also for <unk> who would be <unk>
How would be in the <unk>
Imagine that are the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
It goes up to a open receptor <unk> a sudden, a <unk> in the left of your bombsight <unk> that a little bit on the left of your bombsight is going to be <unk> but the system of <unk> will be <unk>
It was <unk>
Another <unk> you know, there's a open receptor
<unk> <unk>
And you put it up and you look at it.
You don't know where we go on yet, the receptor looks at its bombsight a area of grass that <unk> and can change the career.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The public of the <unk> and <unk> have gotten the work from every day?
This is something that create a huge excitement in the game.
I think that lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the ground,
They want to be their favorite goal.
The reality reality is going to be part of the <unk> because it's too useful to not be.
But what I wonder is, we want this is the only use of the reality <unk>
We're going to use it just as a bread, and <unk> as our light.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think that we can use the obvious reality to overcome the empathy between human beings, to show somebody how it is literally being in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It took thousands of millions to the year, in the year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show you a <unk> how do you get their actions from the perspective of the <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show you the world how they live <unk>
How much is it's also for a <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science and science and the science and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the reality is <unk>
The questions that we do, the decisions that we take and the challenges that we were able to be able to get out of us.
Thank you.
I got a lot after 23 years after 23 years of the <unk> <unk>
Most of those 23 years of the country -- the country was <unk> the south of <unk> County that includes the bridge <unk> <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure known by their beautiful map of San Francisco, the ground, and its <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for Ireland being one of the most used in the world.
The <unk> bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is a lot of <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not no useful or <unk>
But from the middle of the middle of the <unk> people have made their death from that bridge.
Some believe that to travel between the two <unk> you bring it up to another <unk> this bridge has been <unk> as a way that each of you can take them from all your dreams and pain, and the water who are under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that it happens when the bridge is used to make <unk>
After one of each of four to four to five seconds, the body against water about 400 miles per hour.
The impact is going to make the <unk> some of the ones who are going to be <unk>
Most of them in the impact.
The fact that not, usually are <unk> in the water -- and then it gets <unk>
I don't think that the ones who are going to take this method -- you can realize the <unk> death to the <unk>
This is <unk>
Except about the two <unk> there are 32 inches of steel <unk>
Here is where most people are going to get out of the life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is in that way, and in its most complex time is very hard to bring it out of it.
And I took this picture last year while this young man talked about a copy of your life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have no <unk> education.
<unk> to grab the way through these <unk>
This was not just a bad service to those who are going to be <unk> but the <unk>
We've got a long way since then.
Today, and psychologists and psychologists come to the <unk>
This is Canada, <unk>
I met the half of the year of the year of the year of the year to get a call of a kind of <unk> <unk> sitting in the middle of the center.
<unk> and when I came back, I looked at tumors talking about a <unk> bridge <unk>
AK: I had only 32 years and there had been able to here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had been able to come up to here two times before the New Jersey to try to go back from this bridge.
After about a hour talking about a hour talking about <unk> we asked them if I did the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> you never feel that <unk>
Well, one day, the secret could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And she got <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing on the box was hope.
So interestingly, we said, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
And I stopped a few <unk> <unk> on the right-hand side, and he did.
This guy kind of <unk> and <unk> of New Jersey I had just got a life.
I talked about the parents of Canada, that night, and I guess that when I was talking about them, it doesn't seem to be pretty well, because the next day, the family was called me to see how I was.
The parents of course, they had a <unk>
The source of <unk> affect a lot of people.
I know these questions, what do you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved it to be <unk>
What do you do?
<unk> what do that?
In my experience, you don't only have to talk about, but you have to hear.
They can be able to understand.
It didn't be <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how you can feel because you probably don't know it.
There is just there, you can be the point that you need.
If you think that somebody is <unk> not afraid of <unk> and make the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought in order their life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person of the front can save life and be the point for them.
Other signs are <unk> to believe that things are terrible and they never go to <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing that you can do that you can do to be able to make the <unk> and social and a bunch of the interest in life.
I came up this talk about this talk about a couple days, and I got a dream of a lady and I'd like to give you his letter.
She lost his son from January from January from January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple days, and it's with her permission and it is with her permission and <unk> who was <unk>
<unk> <unk> I guess you're in the TED.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that it should go back to the bridge this last week.
I just wanted to give you a distance.
I hope you can tell you a lot of people and go home talking about that to their friends who tell their friends, and so on.
I'm still pretty <unk> but I just think more moments to realize that I was not going to go home.
Mike was sent to <unk> on San Francisco, to see the <unk> of the <unk> with his father at the age of <unk>
They never got there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> as we went on that night.
The next morning two pictures came to my house and I found me from the English car was on the bridge.
A diagram had seen the <unk> from the bridge to the <unk> <unk>
Thank you very close to fight that you can be <unk> too fast to fight themselves.
Who has not been before bad without having a real disease.
It doesn't need to be so easy to end with it.
My couple of them are going to go to your flight.
<unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> is supposed to be a place through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Okay. I think this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she had to go to the bridge and go the way that his son took that day, and also the value to go on.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On 11 percent of 2005, I traveled to a radio called a radio called a radio <unk> in the top of the bridge close to the <unk>
<unk> my <unk> by the <unk> and I looked at this man, Kevin <unk>
When I looked at the <unk> <unk> and he stopped the <unk> and he stopped that small tube that goes around the <unk>
For the hour and a half, I heard like Kevin talked about their depression and <unk>
Kevin decided for his realize that day to go back to the way and give life to the other opportunity.
When Kevin <unk>
"This is a new <unk>
But I said, "What was what made it <unk> and they gave the hope and life and life is <unk>
And you know what I told me.
He said, "I <unk>
I asked me and just <unk>
Shortly after that tree, I got a letter of the mother and I have that letter to me, and I would like to be <unk>
You know, Dr. <unk> don't remember the events of 11 and you're going to be one of the reasons why Kevin comes on with us.
I think Kevin was <unk> by help.
It has been diagnosed with a mental disease, which has been <unk>
And Kevin when I only had six months, completely <unk> from all of those <unk> <unk> but thank God, we now know it.
Kevin is in order, like it is.
You give God for you.
It was not in wealth with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end of the end of the end of the end of San Francisco, that night, you know, as the patient.
I know I know what I had to be <unk>
Kevin is a <unk> father and a heart of society.
Talk like about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that its story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I found in the work.
It's my own.
My grandfather would be <unk>
That used despite the end of their own pain, and you know, the opportunity to do it.
This is what it makes <unk>
For most of the people are <unk> or those who think about it, you don't think in the middle of the person.
They just want your own <unk>
So this is just about three <unk> <unk> drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've got to say, and I've been involved in hundreds of mental diseases and calls around the bridge.
From those incidents that I've been directly around -- I only lost two two, but those two are a lot of a lot.
One was <unk>
The other was a man who talked about a hour.
For that time, I got a hand in three times.
In the end, I looked at the end, and he said, <unk> I got to me, but I have to give me it.
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, yet the great majority of people that we came to play on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have been released from the bridge and lived and you can talk about it, that one of those people have said that the second people have told that the second of those people have told you that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell the people, the bridge is not just moving <unk> with San Francisco, but also people people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that all and each of us we need to be able to do.
<unk> can be.
You have help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your inside you know what you are, and a question you know what you are, and a question you know what you do -- and a question is going to be <unk> How do you get it into that?
I have to be something just in that sense, but I'm not about any way.
When I became a model I felt that I finally had had a dream that had had a child.
My outside eventually <unk> with my good truth with my own.
For complicated reasons, that I took me more later, when I look at this picture I said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the last said, I found that, <unk> I'm going on.
We all took us our families, our family our society, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value value to get rid of the <unk> limitations for the color of the skin or the beliefs of those who are all around us.
They're all the people who always challenge the <unk> which is going to be <unk>
In my case, the last nine years ago, a lot of my neighbors, many of my friends, my child was going to tell my story.
I think this species is called <unk>
This is the mine.
And he went to me as <unk> to the age of my <unk>
I remember that my five years in the advice in my house, I always had to put this guy on your head.
And my mom asked me, "Why do you always take that <unk> in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my book, I'm a <unk>
I knew then how do you do it.
The Chinese has always considered an fact <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and <unk>
Because my success, I was never going to share my story, not because I thought that being what I'm bad but why the world is to those of us who want to <unk>
All the days I really thank you have a woman.
I have old dad and a family who takes me as I am.
Many aren't so lucky.
There are a long tradition in the culture of the <unk> culture, which is the mystery of equality.
There is a bunch of compassion.
There's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when I was eight years ago, I was in the <unk> I was going to take these D.
I was in front of the stage, and I remember that this beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as if something was <unk> This is the kind of woman that I want to be.
And when I had 15 years ago, when I still had a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the middle of a beauty <unk>
And that night she asked me, "Why don't you have seen in the <unk>
He told me that if you <unk> it is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and that night, he won in my bathroom, he won in <unk> <unk> he won in <unk> <unk> and I was a third guy between 40 degrees.
That moment changed my life.
All of a sudden, I was within the world of <unk>
Not a lot of people can say that his first work was from queen of beauty of family and I know it.
I also met the <unk> of the <unk> on the whole time when you go back to <unk> <unk>
But more important than that, I met my best friends of that community.
In 2001 my mom.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, I think I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be an queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you <unk> the America you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all that I needed to hear.
My mom thought I put two <unk> to my name.
And she was also excited when I was going to take me in 2000.
It is curious that in some of the most <unk> cities are going to do the most <unk> <unk>
In that time, in the United States, it was necessary to be able to make surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the <unk> license with the name of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
It was a good time.
For some people, their document of identity means to be able to drive or power to be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live <unk>
And suddenly my fears they saw <unk>
I felt that I could expect my dream and listen to New York, and being model.
Many aren't so lucky.
I think in this woman <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman from New York who was <unk> in the truth, but that, <unk> put their life.
For many of my community, that is the reality that they live.
Our energy rates are eight times more than the rest of the population.
All of the 20 percent of November we do a global <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm in this stage because of a long story of people who <unk> and put it back to the <unk>
These are <unk> <unk> Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, in this same time, I'm coming out of the <unk>
I can't keep living my truth and just for me.
I want to make the best to help the other people to live their truth without <unk>
I'm here, <unk> so that one day already has no more than 20 percent of <unk>
My most profound truth took me to accept what I am.
You do that?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you thank you, thank you thank you very much.
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- I thank I thank I thank you for all my <unk>
I'm going to my mother's network to my family in my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to women, young young women who have been <unk> and a few time, when I was called me and told me that their parents can't take it, I took the phone, called my mom and he said, "Dad, you can call this <unk>
Some times work -- it's not just identity -- that's just what's in the center of what we are, right?
And I mean, all of us were going to bring up a gender and the <unk> and what I try to do is put on the table the subject that I have a space that would allow people to be able to get people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have to have with parents, and this is a conversation that we should have to have
<unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There are still a lot of work to do.
It should have been sick.
I should be space for music, and to do questions, and I hope that all of you are my <unk>
KS: Thank you.
In a lot of traditional societies.
<unk> started his campaign for education, their rights in 2011, their rights in 2011, and when you take their efforts in 2011, the National Institute of peace, he made a very popular girl in its country.
Before that, it was my daughter, but now I am his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you look at the story of humanity, the story of humanity, the story of humanity, the story is the story of the <unk> of violence and <unk>
You see, in the <unk> societies right from the beginning, when I put a child, your birth was not <unk>
It's not sending them not for his father, not for his mom.
And the <unk> neighborhood gives their <unk> to the mother and no no one <unk>
And a mother got a lot for having a child.
When the one day to light to the first child, the first daughter, you get to ask me.
When it gives to light to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when you <unk> his third daughter, it feels guilty like a mistake.
It's not just the <unk> mother but the daughter.
At the age of five years, when you should go to school, you go on home and the school will come back to their <unk>
Until the age of 12 years of some way, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with their friends in the street, and it can move on the streets as a <unk>
But when you go on the <unk> when you look at 13 years ago, you get it to go on their house without a male <unk>
It's <unk> the four walls of your house.
It's not a legal person.
It turns out in the called honor of his father and his brothers and her family and his family and if you get the code of that course -- I could even get able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
And it's interesting that this is interesting that this is <unk> not only affects the life of a <unk> it's also the life of a <unk> also the life of the red members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of their life and happiness from their sisters in the name of course honor.
And there is a more aware of the societies.
It's supposed to be a good girl must be very <unk> and really <unk>
It's the <unk>
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It is supposed to be <unk> and you find the decisions of their father and their mother and the decisions even if you don't can.
If the <unk> with a man who don't like or if the <unk> with a old man has to <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> was very young, it has to do it.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the <unk>
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to the more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson to their daughter and the same lesson to love their children.
And this kind of genome goes on and it comes down.
<unk> brothers and sisters when I was born <unk> and for the first time, I believe that I don't like the best way to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at his eyes, believe I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I was <unk> I thought in his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
Your name was <unk> and called my daughter so for it.
But when I was <unk> all of them were men, and I took my <unk> and I got a line of my name, and I was <unk> <unk>
And when she came out when I had four years ago, and a half years ago, the <unk> in my school.
You can be able to say what I have to talk about a little girl in a school?
Yeah, I have <unk>
You can give them for sitting in Canada, in the United States, in the United States, but in the poor countries, in the poor countries, in traditional societies.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of its identity and his name.
One of the school means that has come on the world of dreams and the aspiration where you can explore their potential for their life.
I have five sisters and any of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when you get it out of the <unk> <unk> and was in the part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any <unk>
That was the reason that value to my daughter.
What my father was not able to give my sisters not to their feet, I thought I had to change it.
I used to see intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
<unk> going to go with me to different degrees.
And all of these values, I've tried <unk> in his personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
And I've got all these good values in my school to girls and kids for it.
I used education for the <unk>
I was going to go back to my daughters, taught the students, to forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found it with a new.
It was illegal for humans and in particular, for the rights rights rights.
It's called <unk>
That means a <unk> <unk> of the expectations of the women in all of our economic policies and social <unk>
Hundreds of schools.
The girls are going to go on to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they left the markets.
<unk> were <unk> the girls were <unk> and <unk>
<unk> million, but a few <unk> and it was thinking, to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really serious.
The 10 years ago, <unk> came up and put it through the right to education.
He wrote a paper for the blog of the <unk> he was offered she was just for the Los York Times, and I talked about every platform that they did.
And your voice was the most powerful voice of it.
They were <unk> as a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate their campaign and nine percent of October from October was made to <unk> in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and for me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I was going to show you to my <unk> <unk> <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> he said, "Why don't you <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> your life in the game of the reality of the truth of peace, and for the cause of education, and the source of education, and your daughter was inspired in you, and your daughter was inspired in you, and you get it away.
They were both in the right way and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot for me, and I didn't go back again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and I had <unk> <unk> and a lot of a head of head because his moral nerve was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow which is <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter was never <unk>
I used to <unk> I am good with my smile <unk> and the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to go good for please not be <unk>
It was a tendency for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters we have learned of her how to resist the most popular moments and I'm going to share with you that even though it would be an icon for the rights rights and women, it's like any weeks of 16 years.
<unk> when you don't just take your task.
They send them with their brothers, and I'm very happy for it.
People ask me, "What is a special thing in my <unk> which has done so profound to <unk> so <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I say, I don't wonder what I did.
<unk> what I didn't did.
I didn't cut their way and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.
I was <unk> from the brain, 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal group.
I'm an engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've got to tell me that I took up to the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> and all the work that I talk about today here about the science of the brain, I did it before I meet Google or outside of my work there.
He thought that this is a pencil when you get it to a brain.
They will be kind of smart or right?
It's not going to be that you can go back to be <unk>
After the <unk> I had a lot of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It was not the white material, but it was the <unk> part of the center that creates important <unk> and <unk>
I had to decide to decide what a lot of <unk> what a lot of a dozen of a dozen of a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything.
Every day, for the last 18 years ago, I've had to decide about the <unk> and you use it out of <unk> and try to get them to keep with life.
More than once I've saved a little time.
But, luckily, I have <unk> <unk> for what I decided to be <unk> to try to get the dose of <unk> because it really doesn't be a clear map that I say in <unk>
I started able to test with different <unk> and I was fascinated to see how small changes in the dose of <unk> <unk> my sense of who was me, my sense of who was me, my sense to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I was able to try to <unk> and chemical chemicals for a <unk> man -- and I was surprised to see how a <unk>
I was always <unk> thought all the time in sex, and I believed that it was the most smart person around the world, and --   Of course, many times in the past I've known several types -- or perhaps some versions of <unk>
It turned out as a end.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a so much <unk> to fix a problem that I had on the front, and it just doesn't happen like that.
So I couldn't do it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that that experience I gave me a new <unk> about men and what they have to be able to <unk> that I have to be better with men.
And what it was about to do to be able to be able to be able to take those nerves and they are, and it was to recover my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking my flow of ideas.
<unk> to think about images, and that became my point of <unk> how to make those mental images that use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This class is not new.
<unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> see the things in similar way.
I thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today, there are the ones that I think about this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how your mind. For me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental for thinking <unk> and <unk>
So after several years ago, I started to find the point right and I have a lot of great <unk> and I have already a lot of great <unk> and really <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring it very fast these images of my mind to the screen of the computer.
You imagine what if a director of film would be able to use their imagination only to create the world that has to be <unk>
Or if a woman could take the music of his mind.
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way people people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is that, the only difficulty to make this is just increase the disease of our brain systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to come to this with two recent experiments that was all of the two numbers in neuroscience.
They were both used to be a picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent the brain here, you can see the brain <unk> that <unk> <unk> and their colleagues in Harvard.
The column of the left shows the <unk> the brain of a person who look at a image.
The column of the middle shows the <unk> of the brain of that same individual while they were <unk> watching that same image.
The column of the right was created <unk> the content of the central column of the left you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with a lot of different different pictures -- always with a similar difference.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagine that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share another experiment. This is the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They were able to turn the brain waves in visual forces.
It looks like this way.
In this experiment, I showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos as it was <unk> their brains to create a huge <unk> of the brain in the video.
And then I showed you a film with images and people new animals, and as it was both <unk> a new <unk>
The computer, using only the brain brain of the <unk> <unk> to show what the person was looking for.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and you see the video that I showed you.
So this was going to make us <unk>
We're very close to it.
We just need to improve the cell.
And now, remember that when you see a picture and when you imagine that same image, it believed in the brain <unk>
This is led to the <unk> systems of the brain brain available today, and its disease is used as a thousand times in the last years.
Now we need to increase the <unk> about a thousand times more to get a more different <unk>
How do you do it.
There are many techniques to do it.
One is open the skull and to introduce them to me.
I don't go to me.
Many are a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of <unk> <unk> techniques -- even I think, <unk> with the recent result of the <unk> first we need to ask it, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The favorite wisdom says that the only way to get more <unk> is the most great way to get more <unk> is in the most big, but at this point, the most <unk> you just have a little way in the <unk> not for thousands as we need.
I'm going to be able to write this idea, instead of the most big, let's make the best <unk>
We can create a lot more complex structures with <unk> different <unk> like doing a <unk>
And why do this happen?
In the last few years, a great amount of effort in which we were to make very large <unk> right?
However, most of the recent breakthroughs in <unk> and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> systems.
And in the time, instead of a magnetic field -- the <unk> patterns of clinical patterns -- <unk> <unk>
So when we combine the business patterns with the patterns of the <unk> patterns of the <unk> patterns of <unk> and we can increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then divide in the ice and our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands of thousands we need.
When we use the <unk> we should be able to measure it not just the <unk> of blood <unk> but the <unk> and <unk> that I've mentioned and perhaps even the visual activity this is the dream.
We can be able to turn our ideas in how our digital media.
You imagine if we could go through the language and communicate directly through <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do you try to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is something big.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> to use as a tool to make our skills of thinking and communication.
It can be the same tool could take the cure of diseases and disease.
We have a few options that open this door.
All of all, you choose a year, happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that you take a lot more.
We have to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about this night about <unk> and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay
I think we all have <unk>
And her will be going to tell you some person for the first time that I love or tell somebody that you have cancer, or any other conversation that you have cancer, or any other conversation that you have to happen in life.
This is a tough conversation and even though our issues can be <unk> the experience of people who lived and have gone out of that <unk> is a universal thing.
It is fear, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working on the South <unk> <unk> <unk> a restaurant, in the city, and there was there, I had to go back several from the intensity of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be <unk> that by the <unk> of my own <unk> and I have <unk> the head I did recently, I asked me, usually a <unk> <unk> you're <unk>
And they had a uncomfortable silence in the table.
<unk> my <unk> a little bit more, I take me my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother got a cold look at his child.
But I would not say anything, and <unk> around it.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where I had a child between three and 10 years was list for a <unk>
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I told me that the next time would say something.
So you have that common difference.
So after a few weeks came again.
You're a boy or a <unk>
A brilliant silence but this time I was <unk> and I was going to come out of full of the <unk> issues in the table   I had the title of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the <unk> <unk> that <unk>
And so I put it back and I went back and I went back and I put it up and I put it up and my head of four years ago with a <unk> <unk> <unk> what is not a challenge for a question: It's just a little girl with a question: You're just a little girl or <unk>
And so a result of <unk> again, I put it out of it, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something that this is kind of <unk>
I have the short hair like the one of a kid and seen her <unk> but I am a girl, and you know, as you like you like you like you like to use a <unk> <unk> and sometimes you like to use a <unk>
Because I am more from the guy of a <unk> <unk>
And that girl looked at me, <unk> <unk> and he said, "My God, it's <unk> and it has a fish.
You can give you a <unk> <unk>
And that was all <unk> <unk> You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the most easy conversation of all that I've ever been before.
And by <unk> because the child of the <unk> and I, both we were <unk> the one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yeah, I mean, my walls used to be a <unk>
But in the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how a really feels living in a <unk>
This is how my <unk> is not different to you or you go or your mind.
<unk> will give you 100 reasons from why you get out of my <unk> was more hard to go from it, but this is the <unk> how hard is not <unk>
It's hard to be hard.
Who can tell me you to explain somebody who are going to explain to somebody who have been able to make a lot more hard to say that has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is more hard to tell your son of five years that you're going to <unk>
There is no more hard, just there is a difficult thing.
We need to leave what is hard to notice about what hard for the other person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
In some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make them feel security, or at least security than what the other side of the door.
But I am here to tell you that it doesn't matter what they are made their <unk> a <unk> is not a place to live.
Thank you.  So imagine 20 years ago.
I, that I had a <unk> tail and <unk> <unk>
It was not the <unk> <unk> <unk> to fight any child of four years that would go to the coffee.
I was <unk> by fear, <unk> in a corner.
My family, my friends, my friends understood that I've spent my whole life, trying to not be <unk> and now the world was going to give it back to purpose.
I was taken up the pages of a list that we all have gotten for both time, but if you don't take that <unk> you can get you.
One of my <unk> <unk> was in the letter of my God!
It was the first time that many of the <unk> knew that it was gay, and to make my <unk> <unk> in my black mouth, and I took it back around the <unk> and eventually I came up to a where the friends of my parents, people who knew I thought I was old.
And after talk about a moment, one of the women were <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had got there.
<unk> I've got on the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> which is your <unk> program.
Our <unk> <unk> and interestingly,
And you know who are <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in order to show you to show you how to make it it was finally that I was in my hand, eventually he said, "Well, sometimes my husband use <unk> <unk>
And I had a chance in that time, as you have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> could be easy to choose where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to go and realize that they were <unk>
And what else you can ask somebody, but <unk>
If you're going to be wrong with somebody, you have to be prepared for the question that we were <unk>
It's so much as the very difficult conversations are still going to go up with my point.
Let's take any with the ones that I have <unk>
But I'm going to go on and I still like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please see this through the religious perspective, but you understand what it means to go out of any point is essentially the same.
Number one: Okay.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
That little girl in the coffee didn't have a <unk> but I was just list for the slides.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the other people need to know that we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Number two: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If you say your parents that maybe you might be gay, they will be afraid that you can change that that could change.
They don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important and more importantly,  Let the music.
You communicate your truth.
They were going to get it out of it.
And some of you can come out <unk> <unk> <unk> so they have done, but I never talk about what they are.
And yeah, maybe some of you feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not the <unk>
That is the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to show you.
So the next time you find in a dark <unk> a <unk> you need to know that we all have been there before.
And you can feel very <unk> but they don't know.
Thank you, <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how you have seen intelligence, an example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> from the question if a machine can think is so interesting as the question of if a mouse can be <unk>
When I was <unk> I wrote this kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of a <unk> to the <unk> <unk>
And so a few years ago, I took a program to try to understand the basic physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from a <unk> <unk> that you don't know anything about the biology of the Earth and in neuroscience of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can look at the Earth, and they have very incredibly small lives so that you can see the Earth for millions of years.
And you see a very perfect effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason would be trying to save ourselves.
We are trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a <unk> <unk> that you don't know anything about this, that doesn't have no concept about intelligence -- you can be forced to develop a physics theory that will explain how, to a certain time in time, the asteroids that we get on the surface of a planet <unk> they leave them to do it.
And so I say this is the same question that we can understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that he took several years ago, I took a variety of issues through science, through science, through a bunch of issues that <unk> I believe, to a single dynamic mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> and for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the developing states that we get the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the middle of the <unk> movement has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to take the skills of the robots to maximize the future freedom of action with the end of making complex life.
And so taking all of these different issues and <unk> together, I said, since it has already several years ago, there's a underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract all these different <unk>
There's only a equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What are seeing is probably the highest equivalent to a <unk> and <unk> <unk> for intelligence that I have seen it.
So what you're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is a <unk> of intelligence is <unk> which acts with the end of to maximize the future freedom of action.
It comes to try to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the choices in the United States with a restaurant, with the diversity of the possible future <unk> Yeah, to a global time, <unk>
In a few words, the intelligence don't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the options too.
And so you have to notice this <unk> is natural to ask, What can you do with this?
What is so <unk> right?
It takes the human intelligence level.
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in Jupiter, you've got to make the <unk> that make more <unk> or <unk> during its life should have to have to be <unk> to the existence of the existence of smart beings like us.
But what happens if that connection <unk> <unk> between Earth and intelligence -- a more <unk>
What happens if the smart behavior is not only <unk> with production in the long term, but actually it actually comes straight from that?
To find it, we have developed a software rate called <unk> designed to maximize the production of Earth in the system in which you can find inside.
<unk> <unk> could happen to spend multiple animal of animal intelligence play in humans, and even making money <unk> everything that had been going to do that.
Here's some examples of <unk> in action.
At the same like a human foot on the <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically -- it automatically -- it automatically a <unk> using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
I just decided for her <unk> <unk>
And this ability to balance to balance to robotics robotics and technologies of human rights.
This capacity to use the tools will be able to be applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
But as some other animals can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to show the food, here in the same time to bring the food, here you see that <unk> can make a version of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic and in a variety of other areas.
<unk> is a variety of <unk>
For instance, here you see it <unk> playing a <unk> game against themselves, <unk> their potential for the game.
So here we look at <unk> <unk> new connections in a social network where the friends are going to get together, and it comes up with success the good network.
This same capacity to <unk> the network also has applications in health and energy and intelligence.
So here we look at <unk> we can organize the rise from a fleet of <unk> we find with success and using the sensor that we can create the global level in the Pacific to the Pacific.
In the same way, they <unk> is <unk> <unk> problems and <unk>
Finally, here we look at <unk> <unk> we find out and take a <unk> strategy in a series of <unk> <unk> in a series of <unk> <unk> <unk> the assets under their rights.
And this ability of risk will have to be a applications of risk and <unk>
Alex <unk> what you've seen is that a variety of <unk> human <unk> such as the use of tools, walk in, and social cooperation and social cooperation -- all of a used that leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
I'll go back to the beginning of the term of the term -- the work <unk> there was always the concept that if <unk> machines would have a <unk>
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest implications of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of <unk> <unk>
It's not that the machines first become smart and then they try to take it back in the world.
It's all the contrary, that the ability to take the control of all the future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence can actually actually be able to take your control, instead of being the thing.
Another consequence is the search of the goal.
I often ask me, how is that you look at <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to happen to go to the descendants to help them to understand the human intelligence or to help us understand the human intelligence -- is this: <unk> has to be view as a physical process that we try to discuss the future freedom of action and avoid the constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We are in a point in the human history of human history, something between the <unk> of stars and lose the planet that we call <unk>
Because in the last years, we've got a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth is in the context of the universe.
The solar mission of NASA has found thousands of possible planets that we connect around other stars, which is that it is only one between the thousands of the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Life is a space space that is the <unk> intensity of the stars when the planets go around in front of them, and they made a little bit of that light to us.
The data came through the context, you show the side of the planets in the distance that there are between them and its mother.
In another, this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> as the <unk> planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get out of their <unk>
On the time, this is going to talk about if these planets that we found are <unk> or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this regions of economic worlds <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
Last year was <unk>
<unk> and ice ice who have been with us from the <unk> now they're all the way in the question of decades.
And these mass changes that we have led to global scale and have been able to change our course.
But I am not a scientific scientist, or <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by stars, with the hope to find places in the universe where we discover life beyond our planet.
You might say that I look for a good opportunities in the global sector.
Now, as somebody very interested in the quest of life in the universe I can say that the most good thing about the Earth, more than our own planet.
Every one of these new worlds comes to a comparison between the planet and the planets that we know how our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit more far from the sun, you can look at a technological world that is in a mission as <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been <unk> in the past and in part, it's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> as the <unk> <unk> its surface is looking at the origins of life and as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the atmosphere -- and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies now provide not just a short <unk> space but also the chance to live in Mars.
But despite all of these images <unk> we remember the <unk> of our planet, places that are connected in our imagination with the ideas and <unk> and <unk> in comparison with the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that they still have for <unk> places really <unk> in comparison with Mars.
Even in the most remote places and more <unk> in the Earth is good and <unk> of oxygen <unk> for our forests in thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the midst of Mars and other planets will be able to be a great and sad and the belief of some that Mars will wait there to save this <unk> <unk> from the only planet that we know that is really real, the Earth.
For a lot that you like space <unk> I'm in profound with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to <unk> the humanity is as we imagine that the captain of the fact is as we imagine that the captain of the truth will have more late in the ground,   Thank you.
But the goals for exploration and the Earth is not <unk>
No, it's actually being being <unk> the goal of understanding and improve life in the future.
The common environments are in our world as <unk>
You just have more close to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep building spaces, in the solar areas, and <unk> of the land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with a <unk> experiment the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, a lot of years ago, the <unk> <unk> <unk> I had to realize that our universe has been around a long time, and we hope that there are many planets in this universe, we should have found the existence of the existence of life to right now.
Well, where are you you?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox paradox is that when civilizations are going to go up to be a professional enough to consider to continue to live in the stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that is to protect the origin of the planets that are going to make this development.
It's <unk> to think about the <unk> <unk> we will save us to us, but the <unk> and space and space and space is <unk>
If we really believe in our ability to go to the solar environments in Mars for the human environments that we should be able to overcome the task more easy to preserve the <unk> in Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, <unk> my own house.
And as I was in the front of the time, looking at my talk, I realized that I didn't have the <unk>
In fact, I could see the window that they were in the table where I had <unk>
So fast I tried to open all the other doors and <unk> and all they were all <unk>
I thought to call a <unk> at least I had my cell <unk> but in California, a <unk> could take a long time in <unk> and it was cold.
I could not go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had a early flight to Europe and the next morning and my <unk>
<unk> but sure that not more expensive than a half night that a half night, so I thought, that despite the right room right right now.
I am a <unk> and I know a little bit about how the brain works.
<unk> <unk> that increases the heart rate <unk> the levels of <unk> and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the <unk> <unk> in the airport, I realized that I didn't have my God!
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask you if there was something that I could do, systems that I could put in their place, which is <unk> which is really bad.
Or at least, if it happens to be wrong, that <unk> the likelihood that is a <unk>
So I got to think about that, but to a month after a month after my thoughts was not <unk>
I was <unk> with my colleague <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and a little artist told me that I went on the window, and I had found me out of me that I had been working with me that I had been trying something called <unk> <unk>
It is something that he had learned from the psychologist Dr. <unk> who had written from this few years before, known as the <unk>
They all know what's the <unk>
Every time there is a technique of experts comes and tries to find what it was wrong, right?
In the <unk> as he says, <unk> you look back and tries to find all the things that you might go wrong, and then it tries to find what you can do to help them to help things care or to minimize the same.
So what I want to talk about about you is a few things that we can do in the way of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> other people are not so <unk>
I'm going to start with it.
And in the house, you get a place for things that they lose very easily.
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there are a lot of science that went to this <unk> on how our space works.
There is a structure in the brain called <unk> which has evolved over thousands of years to make a care of the future things -- where the things are the fish that the trees are <unk> where the fish are <unk> where the people live and <unk>
The grass is the part of the brain that are <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that lets the <unk> to find their <unk>
And if you ask you if you wonder if somebody really did the experiment, they take the <unk> sense of the <unk> and still they could find their <unk>
They didn't use the <unk> but the hippocampus, that really evolved in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that are not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason to lose a car, you know, I read it and <unk>
So in home to take a place for the <unk> a film along the door, maybe a <unk>
To take their <unk> a particular revolution.
For her <unk> a particular <unk>
If you <unk> a place and they're <unk> with that their things always will be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take with the cell and a picture of their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If these things are lost or <unk> this can be <unk>
These are some of the most exciting things.
Remember, when it is under stress, the brain looks like.
<unk> is <unk> and <unk> the thinking.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we will not be in the best time, and you have to put the systems in its site.
And there is perhaps no more compelling situation that when you play to a medical decision.
And in some time, we all will be in that situation, we have to take a very important decision about the future of our medical care or the way of a way to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talk about a very particular medical show.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of a <unk> for all of a lot of decisions and in fact for the process of the financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to take out of the one that you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab, and the death is a little <unk>
They all know that the death is associated with a greater risk of diseases -- <unk> to the heart of your own brain.
So one is thinking that you have the death -- it's not the best, then the doctor says, "I would like to <unk> a drug who will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have been hearing about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today is even likely to know people who <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there is a question that you need to do then, a statistic that you need to ask people that most doctors don't want to talk and companies companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number needs to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who need to take a drug or to be able to be a surgery or to be able to help one person.
And it must think what kind of <unk> <unk> is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor was not <unk> something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, the medical practice doesn't work.
And it's not how a doctor, and if it's <unk> of the scientists like me.
We don't really understand that very good mechanisms <unk>
But the distribution of <unk> that 90 percent of those drugs works just 30 percent of the people.
So the number necessary to try to try the most <unk> <unk> what do you think is?
How many people have to take it before to help a <unk>

This is at the research research of the researchers <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I would look at the numbers.
A 300 people have to take the drug for a year before we will help a only heart of heart, a brain or another event.
Now you might say, "Well, one likelihood in 300 percent of the <unk>
Why do you say, <unk> <unk> the recipe of all <unk>
But then you need to ask the one of the <unk> and it's <unk> of the <unk> effects of <unk>
For this drug in particular, the side effects are used in five percent of patients.
And those include things <unk> <unk> pain and <unk> pain <unk> but now you are -- "The five percent is not very likely to go to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember that under stress you don't think about it on.
So think of how to do this with the time, so you don't have to make the chain of thinking about the flight.
300 people take the <unk> right? A person has been <unk> five percent of the 300 people have the same side effects, that are 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get <unk> by the drug that you help you.
I don't tell you that you need or not take the <unk>
I just tell you you need to have this conversation with his doctor.
The medical page is <unk> is part of the beginning of consent leaders.
We have right right to have access to this kind of information to take the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe you are thinking that I have released this number in the air for the value of the <unk> but actually this number needs to try is pretty exciting.
For surgery that more is going on the biggest men from <unk> <unk> from the cancer for cancer, the number of the cancer to try to be <unk>
So I mean, I was working with a person who has <unk>
And the effects of the case, they make in 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you have lucky and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of the <unk> is to think before the questions that you can make it <unk> the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this in the <unk>
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because it has a lot of time, you want a lot of time, you want a more <unk> life from pain, or a more long that could have a lot of pain to the <unk>
These are the things that you talk about and think of now, with their family and their loved lives.
You can change this in the heat of the time, but the less than you are trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain does, <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens in that moment is that you get a lot of systems.
There's one reason for this.
<unk> to face with a <unk> is not necessary the <unk> system or <unk> or the immune system -- because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, it's not going to be the <unk> you might get to be the <unk> so anything of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window for those moments of stress is the extraordinary thinking like <unk> <unk> and their colleagues have been born.
So we have to be <unk> to think about the future to this kind of conditions.
I think the important thing here is recognize that we all are <unk>
We're all going to find out of the time.
The idea is to think about the future how you might be those <unk> to put the systems where you help to minimize the systems or to avoid that the bad things in the first place.
I took up at the snow night in 1997, when I came out of my journey, my button, I took me a combination of combination along the door, with a <unk> <unk>
And I have to admit that I still have a lot of letters that I don't know, and lots of messages from email that I don't have any time.
So I'm not very expensive, but I see the organization as a <unk> process and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
<unk> <unk> is my favorite music.
It means <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more illusion.
Four <unk> extremely similar.
This is my image of a <unk> tree, you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be able to be able to make a complete silence.
That's my favorite definition of <unk> a very dark sound of <unk>
I'd like to share a little bit about the story of the American system of <unk> the <unk> on a little story.
<unk> language came over the decade of <unk> and with the step of time, and it took the language that we know that we know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and taught me to believe that the sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a world of sounds is as if I lived in a country of <unk> when I lived in a country of <unk> -- when I lived in a country and <unk> their rules, and <unk> <unk>
So how do I understand the <unk>
Well, I see how the people are involved and respond to sound.
People are like my wife, and you get the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds -- and I've seen how many people are.
So I've got to think about example.
"I don't think <unk>
They don't make a lot of noise to eat the bag of <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
All of this I call <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the <unk> sound than the average person does.
I'm <unk> <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, about which is going to come to me.
From there, this happens.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
You can see that the <unk> has no notes in the ground.
That's because the lines are already because the lines already have sounds through the <unk> and <unk>
In the culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it do this with my thumb so it doesn't feel natural.
It's why I just have four lines in paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to <unk> Germany, for a white house, and it was there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
For this summer, I went on, and <unk> and different spaces, and while it was a place to another, I realized that there was no visual art.
In that time, the sound was the tendency and that was called me <unk>
There was no visual art.
Now the sound has come in my field of art.
It's going to get it out of the <unk>
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that not only experience through the face.
I can feel <unk> or <unk> or even as a idea.
So I decided to think about the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in my spiritual decisions.
And all that they had taught me in the sound, I decided to leave and <unk>
I started to create a new body.
And when I came up to the TED community he was <unk> with the amount of support and attention to it.
I realized that the sound is as money, the power, the power <unk>
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was something about a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that I could be <unk> to me and my business work or I could <unk>
I thought I was <unk>
There are a huge culture around the immune language.
And just because I don't use my favorite voice to kill the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can be able to support as well and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in society.
So in school, in school, in the work and men and institutions work with many different <unk>
And your voice becomes my voice and identity.
I help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
<unk> to ask you to take your voices, I am able to keep a direct form of value something like you take a <unk> rate of a very <unk>
If you're not going to keep with this practice, I feel that I could be <unk> in the <unk> and you don't have any kind of social value.
So with the sound as my new <unk> <unk> in the world of the music.
And I was surprised to see the <unk> between music and <unk>
For example, a musical thing, you can't capture and express the paper.
And the same can tell you a concept in <unk>
The two are very active and highly <unk> which means that we can change the basic changes can affect all the meaning as much of the signals as the <unk>
I'd like to share a metaphor of the boat, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> is <unk> in a lot of <unk> <unk>
If you look at a different <unk> for every finger as you get the complexity as the <unk> expression the movement of the body, the water is the body of the body, and so as you get the complexity is a <unk> language as if you get it out just a view at the time.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way to express an concept or idea in <unk>
If you just just be able to be able to be able to change the <unk> create a completely different.
The same thing happens with music in terms of <unk> <unk> and volume.
In order to use these different <unk> <unk> you can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> sign in it.
This is the <unk> sign in it.
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are you <unk>
Oh, <unk>
So I put me to think, and if I see the <unk> through the <unk>
If I had to create a sign and you get it up and it comes up and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun goes and <unk>
This is <unk>
If you <unk> and <unk> the speed and <unk> it looks like a piece of music.
All the day.
I feel that the same can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
This is all night, in this perspective.
And this took me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This is how you take time in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> the present is two hands, the present it makes more close and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is in the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time.
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the past which is my favorite idea with a very cold idea and building at the time, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a music term with a specific rate of four times for <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> <unk> I think about <unk> the same time.
You see, you see <unk> hand hand -- <unk> hand back.
We have the <unk> through the head and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'll show you a way of your hand called <unk> <unk>
You can do it with it.
They all with the hands in <unk>
Now we're going to do it so much in the head like your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system as you know, it's a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages companies around the world.
The second thing that I'd like to teach you is this. please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the <unk> please take it again.
And again.
It's <unk> in <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good work.
Look like the three signs are very similar to see in your head and <unk> but they get very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive, and we are in the same like the music.
However, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sounds that it doesn't have no social value.
We have to start to question what the social value and allow the social value and allow them to get their own value, without you.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be <unk> to learn <unk> not that you have to hear to learn music.
The <unk> is a rich <unk> and I'd like to have the same experience.
I would like to be <unk> to open your eyes, open the eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know you can be able to fall out of us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> I am me.
As a child, my parents said, "You want to <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom is responsibility.
But my imagination came to me to all of these places where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a <unk> bubble or a bubble of ignorance -- I have to say, because the adults are going to tell us to protect us to protect us from the whole truth.
At the end, I got a lot of the adults also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean the other.
The country, now I'm the Chinese and I teach them and invention in school school, of Hong
You don't have to wait a lot for a lot for my students to walk out by the beach <unk> with lots of <unk>
So as good citizens, we have <unk> the <unk> and no, it's not <unk> <unk> and if it was, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but today over 80 percent of the oceans have sex from.
It is something <unk>
And in the last decades, we have been coming out with these big blood and networks, to collect these pieces of plastic and <unk> these pieces of plastic and <unk> and <unk> this information in a map.
But it turns up and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive to use those <unk>
So along with my students, with the age of six to 15 years ago, we had to invent a better way.
We've transformed our small classroom in Hong
We started building this <unk> <unk> <unk> so that the kids really <unk> they can also be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get out of the <unk>
And I'm going to tell you the children that we make a <unk> tools feel great and secure.
I don't know.
Let's go back to patients.
We put the plastic and we put it into the size that we found it on the ocean, which is very small, because of her <unk>
And that we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is trying to take the best ideas of every child and try to get them into something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collect pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
In the use of a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the children <unk> a lot of <unk>
After we create quickly what we call <unk> <unk>
We are so fast in the creation of Twitter that we ended up before a doctor.
And we took <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in a extreme robot that will move back through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image of the robot.
We see the oil of the plastic impacts even through the sensor as the computer in the sensor as the computer of the <unk> and measure the size of every <unk> to get a view of the number of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step up in a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that somebody would be able to make them even more.
The great thing in this project is that the students saw a local problem and <unk> are trying to be <unk>
I'm going to investigate my <unk> problem. But my students in Hong Kong are the very good children.
You see the news news -- <unk> Internet, and it comes up with this <unk>
A child, perhaps less than 10 years ago, it was a oil oil just using the hands in <unk> the <unk> <unk> the greatest <unk> in the world.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is where the water is where the water where they live.
You can see it also that the water is <unk> and the oil and the oil are also very hard to see what is in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what is in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can be <unk> through all kinds of ways that make different <unk> which can help identify what is in the water.
<unk> this prototype with a sensor and we put it into it.
The great thing about this project is that more from solving a local problem or about looking at a local problem or the students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help them control other children.
I saw a problem to <unk> I saw I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit more far, maybe to make a more difficult problem and also about me.
I'm half teams and half French and perhaps remember that in 2011, there was a common earthquake in Japan.
It was so <unk> that you know, a lot of carbon waves called <unk> and those <unk> and these <unk> and those <unk> and those <unk> and those <unk> and those <unk>
More from 14 people died in a second.
It also gives the plant of nuclear energy -- an nuclear nuclear energy is going to move into water.
And today, according to the death of a 300 billion tons of the ocean is still <unk> of the nuclear plant in the ocean Pacific.
Today, all the Pacific Pacific has <unk> <unk>
If we are going to the <unk> coast, we can measure the fuel of <unk> everywhere.
But if we look at the map, it seems that the most part of the death of the <unk> coast and the majority of the time, it has really funny, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more than that.
And I've been going to <unk> every year from the accident and <unk> in the way in the car, with other scientists, the land, and this time we wanted to take children.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't do it.
But every night <unk> the center of <unk> here you see the use of <unk>
It might seem to do that they didn't take the hard work, but I know it because they're going to live with the <unk> all its life.
<unk> with them to understand the data <unk> that day and we talk about what we were going to do later, the <unk> the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we create a <unk> map of the region around the region around the ocean of energy power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent data in real time of the <unk> and <unk> water to take the rain.
So with this we could notice that the dust would be <unk> from the top of the mountain to the system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk>
But with the base of this we organize a civil percent, the most close to the nuclear gene to the date.
We put up to a hundred miles from the nuclear power and with the <unk> aid of the area we went to play out of the sea floor with a <unk> of sediment as we had to test and develop it.
So here we see a <unk> we have gone from a local problem to a global problem.
And it has been very exciting to work in these different different technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it has been getting more expensive, because we've only been beginning to measure the information we've made.
We didn't even start trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent the best ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became a very small so so so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the greatest space to the social impact to the social impact to the social impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, and a little place where we can work almost all there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can be actually with the aid of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For example.
Or we can be able to help care of the population of the age of the age of the age of the age of the <unk> in the standard of the global <unk>
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> but the worst legacy that we can leave our kids are <unk>
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible things because we need their imagination to invent solutions.
So citizens -- scientists, <unk> we need to take the next generation for the environment and people, and so it really can really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of radically fundamental design.
A one is made of thousands of carbon pieces -- the one of a just <unk>
One of them is <unk> the other word.
One of the environment, the other <unk>
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
<unk> told you that when he looked at the <unk> in <unk> I saw a approach that will fight for being free.
The <unk> was just a single tool of <unk>
But the living things are not <unk>
They are.
And in the most small units of life, the cells, we took all the information that we used for every cell and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution has the world of design has been taken by <unk> and production in mass.
<unk> lines have developed a whole world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects to think of their objects as a <unk> of parts of <unk> different functions.
But you don't have a <unk> material in nature.
Think about the human skin for example.
Our <unk> are <unk>
The complexity of the back are more <unk> with small <unk>
You can be mainly like <unk> the other mainly as <unk> and yet, it's the same <unk> there is no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that you can bring up their power through the variation of <unk>
Here is a <unk> screen that represents my vision of the world <unk> the <unk> of every designer and an architect to work now between the <unk> and the DNA between the machine and the organism, and that is between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
And these two visions of the world, my left corner.
My work, in the most simple level, it's going to bring these two visions of the world, coming out of the <unk> and move into growth.
You probably ask you ask, "Why is now?
Why was not possible this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a very rare moment where you get four channels that offers designers access to the tools that we never had access to before.
And in the intersection of these four fields my team and I can.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We used objects, objects, and tools through millions of a big scale, like this light arm with a bird from 24 feet with an basis that some day not very far to print buildings and <unk> and <unk> in the United States of <unk> experiments -- <unk> that they would get in the darkness.
So here we have been <unk> the <unk> is a jar of the ancient architecture and has created a screen where every single <unk> is the only for the way of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility to create a layer and a <unk> this was for a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> It's like a second skin made of a single piece, <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
<unk> with <unk> 3D printing <unk> this layer and <unk> the cells will show you more objects like that.
This <unk> <unk> materials, and <unk> in the middle of 20 <unk>
This is the <unk> of a human hair.
It's also the <unk>
And that designers have access to this extension of the <unk> and the instruments we were able to design products that are <unk> not just the way of our bodies, but also the structure of our own.
We also designed a <unk> chair a chair to visual <unk> and also you can make sound.
The TED professor came up to the nature for <unk> and to design this pattern of the surface of the surface it becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of the different different different different of the different different different different different <unk>
Their surface, as in nature, you can be able to change the power of other material or another <unk> but <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
But it's the nature <unk>
There is no parts in me."
I didn't read me in a high high home and when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and they got a lot of what I care about.
As she said, "In the third day of the <unk> God loves the Earth to make a <unk> tree, <unk> <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would have no difference between integration that leaves and <unk>
All the tree was a <unk>
In change, the land made trees and <unk> <unk> <unk>
The land created a world made of place.
I often ask me, "What would you be the design if the objects was made of a single <unk>
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we look at that the material is <unk> the kind of material of the tree of the tree, and we found it.
The second <unk> <unk> in the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of tons is getting every year for organisms as <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We think if we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make structures <unk> in a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> the <unk> and we were <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> we've been able to get a wide range of <unk> from <unk> hard and <unk> to light light, and <unk>
To print the amount of a big scale, they built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could be <unk> the properties of the material and create these structures made of a single material -- a single piece of years ago, 100 percent.
When the pieces of the pieces are <unk> the leaves to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a <unk> from the printing process was used to contain <unk> <unk> that came up for the first time in the planet makes a billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
With our collaborators with our collaborators in Harvard and MIT, the bacteria designed experiments to capture quickly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that they make their transition without <unk> problems and if you get it even more to it.
A tree <unk> <unk>
It works with a ancient material, one of the first forms of life in the planet, with <unk> water and with a little bit of quantum biology, we have transformed a structure made of shrimp from shrimp in a architecture that is known as a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects designed to <unk> <unk> in the ocean, <unk> life and put on the ground, you can grow a tree.
This is for our next space using the same principles of design was the solar system.
We look at the chance to create their life to keep the life for <unk>
And to do that, we have to bring the bacteria and control their <unk>
So as the <unk> <unk> we did our own <unk> <unk> new forms of life that we created <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about biology biology like the <unk> <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> <unk> <unk> new <unk> within very small.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of somebody, you get two <unk>
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the <unk> of the water.
And the second one, you know, <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human.
It turns out the light on sugar, the other <unk> sugar and it produces a lot for the building environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, I was never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of it.
Think about that as we are, not for natural selection but evolution for design.
To create these relationships, we have created a single way that is <unk> the <unk> <unk> to help them to take these bacteria and that they <unk> their function and the way that the function of the way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, and the properties of the material would be <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> system when you turn out of a end of the other, it's about 60 feet.
This is half of the laws of a dynamic field and 10 times more than our <unk>
And here it is like <unk> in TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels in life within it.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We're <unk> creatures -- only half is <unk>
What if the design would take the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the
And if we could create a personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think about this as a way of <unk> biology.
I call this of the material.
So you always have to go back to nature.
And so you know that a 3D printer is kind of material that we can be able to be able to make a physical printer in it.
You also know that nature doesn't do it.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This <unk> of the <unk> for example, create a very strong architecture a home within which you were <unk>
The manufacturing is not <unk> it is about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but of two proteins in different <unk>
One acts like structure, the other is the <unk> or <unk> <unk> those fibers between it.
And this is happening through scales.
The surface of the surface is the first step in the environment, it creates a structure, and then it starts to <unk> a <unk>
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they talk about a single material.
With the end of understanding the best how this complex process, we can take a little bit of the head to the head of a <unk> <unk>
We put it within a box with sensors with sensors and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the <unk> of <unk>
However, when I put the magic scanner in a restaurant, not within a box, we realized that <unk> a <unk> <unk> and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different <unk> different <unk> and we've found that the way, the <unk> the structure of the <unk> is going directly directly through the environment.
It often <unk> the forces of the behavior in the death within the death within their <unk> and it uses it up and used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we can give it to the <unk> communication without a only <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we do this process to the collective scale.
And we had a robot <unk> doing <unk> and we put it into our site.
We knew that the fields of <unk> <unk> to the most active areas and <unk> that we use a <unk> diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the light of light and heat, and the forces of the structure on the structure.
We were prepared to get <unk>
We have a lot of <unk> forces to a global farm system.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put it up in the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the <unk> and while <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts as us, as us, but a lot more <unk>
<unk> Watson said that the tension is the great <unk> and I was right.
At the <unk> global media on the <unk> <unk> <unk> take all this <unk>
And in a little bit more than three or three weeks, we were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in a curious <unk> this is also the length of the <unk>
The <unk> after the <unk> they make a billion eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> in the future.
So here are the two parts of the world.
A <unk> <unk> by a molecular arm -- the other full of <unk>
If the last title of design is to give to the products and the buildings that we have, to form a scale of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
What it takes us from around, of course, the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, that brings us from a inspired inspired in nature to an nature in nature to an nature in design, which is going to be able to do in nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked it, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what they were used when they asked them for the first time.
You can <unk> with the toes.
You know, you know, <unk> <unk>
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has been giving some kinds of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who never could answer the question "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I didn't have any interest but I had <unk>
In school I loved the English and the art and the art and the art and developed in the website.
Maybe you've heard about us.
And now I like to test and <unk> of all of all, because we have spent a long time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this sense of <unk> this feeling is because this is not a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to get it on.
But then I went to me over the other thing, something completely different, and I'm going to go on it, and I will say, and I feel <unk> I've found the <unk> and then then this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to go back.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go on it.
This pattern took me a lot of dignity for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure what was going to turn all this in a career.
I thought that I had to choose a thing, they would be able to choose all my other <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Another reason that led me so much anxiety was a little bit more.
I was worried that there was something bad in this, and something bad in me for not <unk> for anything.
I was worried to be afraid to <unk> or to be <unk> or <unk> or my own success.
If you can combine my story and these thoughts would like to ask you something that I'd like to have been given then.
I know themselves, where they learned the meaning of bad or freedom, to do things.
I'm going to tell you where the <unk> was known in culture.
So you know, you want to be <unk>
And when we have about five years.
And the truth is that no one really matters what they were going to do that age.
It looks like a high question to make good answers in kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> here.
This question is going to give us one and over the other time as we get out of different <unk> <unk> <unk> in high school students are going to give you to choose in college.
And in some time, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the beautiful exercise before what you can take the dream.
Why?
If you look at this question for the kids to dream with what you might be, I don't don't know about to dream with everything you might be.
In fact, it's just the contrary, because when somebody ask you what you want to be, because when somebody ask you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though adults are not <unk> but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You've got to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk> 
And this <unk> <unk> Center in <unk> <unk> <unk> and creative people.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All that you hear is that they are going to have to get to them.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is really <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of the fate or the real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something that we do for their time in this land, and you have to find what that thing and spend their life to it.
But if you're somebody who are not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different different issues that show their light, and many different things that wants to do?
There is no place for somebody like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And they feel something bad with one.
There's nothing bad in you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with a lot of some interests and creative business.
It's a <unk>
It could be able to help them if you look at three <unk> <unk> potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we get the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
For the age of the <unk> the ideal was who I was good <unk> in multiple degrees.
<unk> <unk> is about us as <unk>
<unk> any term that you like or <unk> you like it.
It seems like a kind of copy to a community, we can't be able to agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as the limitation or <unk> that you must get to come.
But what I've learned talking about about people and writing about these ideas in my website, is that there are huge strengths to be this way.
Here's three <unk>
One: <unk>
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their personal interests in <unk> <unk> and design and design and design to <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this idea for its <unk> mix and experiences.
The innovation is happening in the cosmos.
And there are the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all of their <unk> you can access to a great amount of these points of <unk>
The second <unk> <unk> is the fast.
When we were <unk> we get together to something, we're going to do it.
We see everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to be <unk> because I have been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid to test things and come out of our <unk>
Many skills are <unk> and we bring everything that we have learned every new area that <unk> so that we still start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> at time and white <unk>
As a little child, <unk> a incredible capacity to develop memory memory.
Now, she is the most fast <unk>
Before they become <unk> <unk> was <unk>
He had to learn the <unk> mechanics when they started their <unk> and this ability helps to write to write <unk> for <unk>
<unk> is a loss of time to do what you were going to be <unk> even if the end is <unk>
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a different field of a way that you can't have <unk>
The third <unk> <unk> is say, and I mean, the ability to focus on any thing that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of <unk> others, a few pages of the website, sometimes <unk> sometimes <unk> <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good work.
He is even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their <unk>
The <unk> magazine <unk> <unk> as the most important ability for developing development in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so fast and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations who can be <unk> to meet the needs of the market, the <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you might lose if they're a <unk> to reduce their goals.
As society, we have a great interest in <unk> to the <unk> who are themselves.
We have a lot of complex problems now -- and we need creative and we need creative and we need creative and we need creative and we need creative <unk>
I mean, they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> <unk> because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
You don't worry, there is nothing bad in you.
In fact, some of the best teams are made of a <unk> and a <unk> <unk>
The physician can happen in the depth and put them in a ideas, ideas and <unk> offers a <unk> of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we all should do that we should all design lives and keep them to be able to be doing how we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a great part of them <unk> that you just just be more like their <unk>
Once I said this, if there is one thing that you can take out of this talk, I hope that it's this: <unk> with <unk> <unk> is what it is.
If you is a heart of heart, then, <unk> all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who you just take to be one of them in the last 12 minutes,   I say, <unk> with their many <unk>
You're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to take it out of those <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> our organs can lead us to a more real life and happy.
And perhaps the most importantly, you get the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year of the year of a woman called <unk> he took them to a simulation in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember the most basic details of their life.
Your doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help them <unk> but <unk> for her until that until that, by that until you know, in <unk>
After her death, <unk> made a <unk> and they found some strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of a guy who never had seen before.
The most importantly, it doesn't even exist.
If you <unk> I had been living today, we could have been living today, we could not give them a lot of aid that I gave them <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call disease of disease.
Since <unk> medicine has been a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> a lot of policies for cancer, which is the <unk> and much more.
But it has a little bit about the treatment of disease.
I'm part of a scientists who work to find a cure for AIDS since a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
<unk> now affects 40 million around the world.
But we can affect 150 million that, by the way, you get a lot of you.
If you expect to live up to the 85 years or more, the possibility of people are going to be almost one of every two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that you're going to spend their years <unk> <unk> or helping care about a friend or to be able to care with disease.
Not only in the United States, the health care is about 200 billion every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is spending in the disease of disease.
Today, it's the most expensive disease and their costs is <unk> a increase of five times in the year, as we get the generation of the <unk>
It can tell you, but the diseases is one of the biggest challenges doctors and social and social and social survival.
But it has been relatively a relatively little for <unk>
Today, one of the 10 causes of death all the world is the only that you can't be able to make a cure or even it might be able to be able to be able to solve their development.
We understand less of the diseases that of other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spent 10 times more every year in the research research despite the cancer despite the fact that it costs us more and cause a number similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources must be a more fundamental cause the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what that time you know, but all the world is <unk> is a disease, and we can be <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years of the last <unk> -- all of the scientists -- we were going to be able to be the scientists, of engineering with aging.
We think that you can be <unk> in a normal part of the normal part of the <unk>
But just there is just looking at a picture of a healthy brain brain in comparison with the one of a death patient to see the real physical <unk> for this disease.
In addition to take a <unk> loss of memory and skills that is the brain to the brain caused by autism that is possible the hope of life and it's always <unk>
Remember, Dr. <unk> I found <unk> and <unk> in the brain of <unk> a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today, we know that they're made of the molecules of energy.
You can think of a protein of the protein as a piece of paper that it looks like as a difference?
There are places in paper that are <unk>
And when you look at this, these dots are going back on the inside.
But sometimes things are going wrong, and some of them are going to get in the outside of the <unk>
So this makes the molecules that the brain is going to be able to be <unk> to be able to make big <unk> and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with disease.
We've spent the last 10 years in the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this works.
There are a lot of <unk> and the title of what happens is complex is complex as a crime.
<unk> a guy could do anything.
<unk> the others can make the bomb <unk>
There is that to find the right step that <unk> and then create a drug to do it.
Until it makes a little bit, in the most part of them have gotten the cables and expect it better.
But now there's a bunch of creative group of people, doctors, <unk> <unk> <unk> engineers and LT:
And together, we've been able to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's a new kind of drugs that represent specifically this step to stop disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
No one of our lab has seen it.
Let's take a few videos of what happened to test these drugs in <unk>
These are the <unk> <unk> and you can see that they move with normal.
And these <unk> over the other side, they have the molecules that you get together between each other, as in humans with disease.
And you can see that they're clearly <unk>
But to give our new drugs to these fields in a stage stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a very positive result but research as this shows that diseases is a disease that we can understand and <unk>
After <unk> years of <unk> there are real hope of what you can spend in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so we can take that hope, of <unk> the future, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to be <unk> which is a disease and that if you <unk> we can be <unk>
In the case of other disease, the patients and their families have gotten more research and <unk> pressure on governments, and <unk> and <unk>
That was essential to move in the treatment of HIV to the end of the 1990s.
We see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But the <unk> patients can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> of their life <unk> and night, they're often too <unk> to get and spread for change.
So really depends on you.
<unk> is not in most cases a genetic disease.
All the world with a brain turn the risk.
Today, there is 40 million patients like <unk> that you can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help them to take a cure.
Thank you.
<unk> this article in the column of the World York Times, in January of this year.
To fall out of somebody, do this.
The article is about a very, very designed study to create romantic love in the laboratory, and my own experience to test my own night at the past time.
So the procedure is pretty simple: Two strange <unk> to be able to be 36 questions and then both you look at the eyes without talking about four minutes.
Here's a couple of example.
Number <unk> if you could take the morning with a quality or food, what would be?
Number <unk> when it was the last time you get back to another one.
And <unk>
<unk> <unk> these are every time.
Number <unk> <unk> I really <unk> <unk> <unk> to your partner what you do about he or <unk> and I know things that you don't mean somebody who have been <unk>
When I took me with this study a few years ago, a very few years ago, a really really struck me the attention, the time that two of the participants were married six months later and invited around the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making love love but from course I was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this study, with somebody who knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect <unk>
However, we were <unk> and  And I thought it was a good story, so I would turn it to the column of the column of the column with a lot of months later.
That was published in <unk> and now it is already <unk> so I guess some of you probably you know, they are going to get together together they get together together.
And the reason I think about this is because I have done this is because I have done this one one and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's look at it.
A week before you put the article was very popular.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had to write about my experience in love love in my friends.
But a blog can get to about hundreds of seen as a lot, and those were still about my Facebook friends and I thought my article in the New York Times is probably about thousands of it.
And that uses a good kind of attention in a relatively new.
But as he had had no idea.
The paper was published on the line in the night, and because of it this happened in the middle of my <unk>
And the <unk> I had been called the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received more than eight million <unk> and I was, by saying something, a little bit prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is <unk> the confidence writing with <unk> about small experiences -- but another thing is to discover that the <unk> life has been a international news --  and that people all are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call them or <unk> what they did every day for weeks -- where every day for weeks -- where every day for weeks -- all the same question, still they still still go.
In fact, when I was taking this talk, I did a quick search in the right-hand side of my email with <unk> <unk> still <unk>
And several messages came out there.
And they were in students and they were <unk> and <unk> <unk> like this.
I was born in the radio and <unk>
But I took a talk, and a woman gave up to the stage, but <unk> where your <unk>
And I thought I got red away.
I think this is part of the problem.
If you write about your relationship in a money, you should wait that people feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not going to be prepared for the <unk>
<unk> questions like to be <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> that <unk> the experiences of the factors to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first deal for all of this attention was being very excited with my own relationship.
I said that we don't have to do a lot of the ones that both we did a public emergence together.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
I think I was afraid of becoming the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> process of <unk> a range for what I didn't feel like <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know if the study work work, they wanted to know if I really was able to produce love -- I mean, if it was able to produce love <unk> not just a <unk> but love love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship had just just about a few months, and I felt about everything, that people did the wrong question.
How do you know if you get together, or not, and they were going to be able to <unk>
If the answer was not, I would do the experience of doing these <unk> questions.
Dr. Steve <unk> wrote the first about these questions in this same study in there, and there, the goal of the software was not to produce love <unk>
And instead of that, I was looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> to the previous students using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It sounds love right?
But I did it work.
The participants were used more close to doing a number of <unk> studies that we were also used by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as a quick way to create confidence and interaction between strangers.
They have used in the members of the police and the community. And they have used to the people of <unk> political policy.
The original version of the story, which I took the past summer that we took the summer in four minutes with four minutes with four minutes of visual contact was <unk> in this room, but unfortunately it never got it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a small university <unk> and then a student came to me and told me to me, and he told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say you <unk> the person with who they <unk>
Well, he made a country?
I think she just want to be friends.
And I said, But they became better foods.
<unk> that I know they were able to make a lot better after a <unk>
<unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was born.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that any of you is looking for when it's about love.
I learned with the study for the first time when I was <unk> And I was going to be a really difficult.
There were that relationship since I had 20, what I had 20, what I had 20, what I was a real life, and he was my first love -- and he had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I went to me in science.
I was all that I could find about the science of love I love and I knew that that I could have a certain way <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this in the moment I thought that I just went to the book for the book that I was writing but it seems really <unk>
I thought if I was <unk> with the knowledge of love I would never have to feel as bad and used me then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful from one or another way.
I'm more patient with love I'm more <unk>
I have more trust what you want.
But I also can see you more clearly and I can tell you that what I look for is sometimes more than you can take me to me.
And what I look at the love is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and it will be <unk> -- but that will keep being <unk> by the person who I love me.
It can be that this is the <unk> about the people that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
And the story that the means talked about the <unk> questions is that you can have a <unk> for <unk>
It may be a way for some way to get something of the <unk> something of the <unk> and this is a very <unk> story because it makes us feel <unk> but it's also a lot.
But I think when it's about love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story that I mean, yet they still still go.
And its content with a <unk> response or No.
So more than a question, <unk> that we do questions more hard questions like, How do you decide who it deserves your love and who right?
How do the things to stay <unk> when things are <unk> and how do you know when they cut and <unk>
How do you live with the <unk> that inevitably it takes a <unk> or even more, how you live with the question of your <unk>
I don't know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to be.
So if you want to the short version of the story of my relationship, it's <unk> a year, a year, a year, a year, and I apply a designed designed to create love love -- we were still going to go together, and I'm very <unk>
But it was not the same thing that they will stay <unk>
<unk> is the easy.
So at the end of my article <unk> the love doesn't happen.
<unk> <unk> because we take the choice to be.
And I put me a little bit to read now, not because it's not true, but because in the time, I had no really considered everything that was supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be all that <unk>
I didn't have a few times we would have both to take that change and how sometimes I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and say, <unk> questions, I would have been to love somebody so <unk> and you have to get that choice in the largest year in the United States.
But what I've made in change, it's turning my relationship in the kind of myth that I don't think of true.
And what we were <unk> and what you can spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the end of the happy -- I would want to be the first part of my <unk> which is the only part of the paper that I actually didn't know.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to ask somebody, and the hope that he also was, and it's <unk> but that is how I try to love.
Thank you.
I went up for a lot of <unk> in the mountain and in a certain way I got as a <unk> of the World
In the city of New York makes a time.  Something that I really used me but more details over it.
I'll start with when I had eight years.
And I took a <unk> box and <unk> a mortality of a dollar -- a <unk> and a <unk> in her in a little place in <unk>
And I thought that some of the strange <unk> or a few years ago, we find this one about 500 years later and <unk> how our kind of <unk> ideas -- for example, how our kind of <unk> ideas how our <unk>
I didn't have no idea.
All of all, it has <unk> because here I am, 30 years later and I still am doing it.
In a moment since I was in <unk> <unk> like to go to <unk> and all of those things -- and I was doing a <unk> for my mom.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and I did a kind of <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, my mother has afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so you get more <unk> in the <unk> thinking that I could <unk>
Instead, it happened on the other way it seemed to be able to turn it to size, as if it was going to be <unk> with a <unk>
So I did that I did that I did that I did that I did that I was going to build over it.
And this time, I started to add those elements that we can find out of a lot of chemistry that was finding by the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I put me to draw around objects, and I realized that God can go on space.
I can turn it up with <unk> <unk> like it makes around a <unk> in the scene of the crime.
And I put the objects and created my own <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> that you can make a idea.
And then I did a few insects and creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started to build <unk> and those things, and I was making something of money, to bring my girlfriend to me, for example, going to <unk>
It was <unk>
In some time, I was interested for the human way of the natural size of the natural size of human size within it.
It was great, except for one thing:
I didn't know what to do, because I was going to get it to me.
And I was going to the bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use <unk>
I started draw on the ice ice -- similar to the image in a window then on another window and another window and I had all these windows together, and I had all these windows together to bring them a three-dimensional building.
And this really work, and so I could just leave you to use the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work was <unk> with something very big, that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I inspired me in great as a <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
<unk>
Well, it's a fantastic.
They tell you that it's a little bit like a time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
It's a few feet old.
It has <unk> by what they're 10 feet away.
It's a little bit.
Well, that's the source of blood.
The left left, and the <unk>
There are a cave where all of these creatures with the city of animals will come into two worlds.
You're the world of the <unk> to this <unk> <unk> where it was <unk>
Here is where the creatures with the city of animals are going to go into the <unk> <unk> for <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is made of thousands of elements.
This is a bird painting to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> there are all kinds of things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
All of the way, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and you get oil in a hand while that the other hand is going to come up to you.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems a <unk> that comes on the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of <unk>
It's a bit a bit of an narrative.
That's the hand in the <unk>
And then, when you go on the other side, you have a <unk> like a <unk> <unk> and you walk out of this <unk>
It also has a tail for a hundred feet over a long tail who took to the <unk>
All of all, its <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things you know, you know, you know.
Their tail ended up in a <unk> balloon of <unk> <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They did it in the decade of 1980, as if they were <unk> from terrorists.
Very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> you're called <unk>
It's about a project of six years to do 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a simulation of our culture, through the media and material is <unk> <unk>
But every single acts as a kind of simulation in the way of human to be human, and they go in groups of 20 or 12 or 12 again.
They're like cells, they are <unk>
And you can walk out of them.
Each one is basically a <unk> of microscope that comes up with some of a human <unk> with a human living in its own.
This has a little cave in the <unk>
That's the <unk> it's <unk> <unk>
And you know, by the rest of the body of the body, there is a <unk> that goes on the chest and you get the <unk> or <unk> or what it has has a kind of <unk>
It is a small letter of these works because I can't take it for a long time.
We have <unk> you can see.
This is a public body for half.
This has two and it is constantly <unk>
There are a little bit that they come up and come on the head of this famous event.
There's a small scene within the <unk> <unk>
You can <unk>
All of all, this talk is about these <unk> as the boxes that we live.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physical <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a museum, a museum, which is the whole content we do in the world, and a garden.
And it took the box and all of people within each other, about other as a particles.
And I think that is the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box in which it's a lot.
And together we came to realize that we all are together in this, that this version of the countries that we are different these concepts of the countries, of the countries of the countries of the countries, of religion doesn't work.
We are all really made of the same things and the same box.
And if we don't start to understand those things with <unk> and <unk> all we're going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you talk about it.
They take a <unk>
But so that you have to be able to be able to be able to the pain, first goes on the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
I take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> for any individual drug in the body.
<unk> <unk> is that the <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a great problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs <unk> these <unk> <unk> the amount of viruses in blood, and increase the <unk> cells.
But they're also known by their side side effects in its majority because in the time that you take them to the <unk> <unk> <unk> and worse even for the time that you take into the <unk> which is where it's more importantly, in the supply of HIV.
And these are regions of the body like <unk> <unk> the <unk> system where the virus is <unk> and they don't go very easily in the world of the patients who are going to get up to the <unk> of the patients who are going to be <unk> with drugs with drugs.
However, after the sold of the treatment, the virus can give and make new stem cells.
This is the great problem of HIV in HIV with drugs that is a treatment of life <unk>
A day, I felt and I thought, <unk> to make the treatment directly to the <unk> of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for <unk> and surgery or surgery that we can be used for any other <unk> including <unk> <unk>
In fact, we are using <unk> <unk> to open or a extremely small holes that open and <unk> and it almost developed the cells associated with HIV for HIV to protect the drugs.
And the best thing you say, "How is that that <unk>
We put a little bit of a little bit of a little bit a little bit of <unk> about the solar cell cell in HIV whereas these cells are based on a <unk> which has the ice rate.
The laser goes on the cell cell, as the cell absorbs the drug in the question of years.
Before you even know that, the hole is <unk>
We are taking this technology in <unk> or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology to the human body, you apply to the human body.
"How is that you can be <unk>
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our husband, we will do a <unk> in the site.
The second head, which is a camera, it's going to be going to the site.
And finally, the third head, a <unk> which is <unk> the way it looks straight on the place of <unk> as the laser is used to keep the stem cells.
Well, this isn't a lot of time.
But one day, if you have success, this technology can lead to the total of HIV the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all of the <unk> in our case, a treatment with <unk>
Thank you.
In the last decade I've studied to <unk> groups -- not <unk> organizations like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
<unk> what these groups are when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand the best of these agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition of the <unk> <unk> to the <unk>
I do work in the field, in the world of politics and the library.
To understand these groups is key to solve almost all conflict in course, because war has changed.
I used to be a <unk>
no.
Now it's a conflict between states and the actors didn't understand.
For example, of the <unk> <unk> peace of peace and 2011, and 2011, it came up between a state and a <unk> didn't take it.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even need to be <unk> or <unk> in any design process of economic conflict.
But how do we do that?
We have to know what these organizations.
We know very good for the reasons that you do, how do they do, but no one hand, what do you do when they didn't be <unk>
The height of the <unk> and policies are not <unk>
All of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups are so complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for their <unk> <unk>
From their creation in the decade of 1980, <unk> also has been taken a political <unk> a network of social and a military device.
At the same way, the <unk> <unk> known for their <unk> <unk> against Israel, also giving the <unk> of 2012, from 2007.
So these groups make more than you just understand it.
They're <unk>
It takes a complex source of <unk> <unk> <unk> channels in TV, sites and strategies in social networks.
And here's the <unk> magazine in English and published for <unk>
<unk> groups are also spending in a complex <unk> <unk> but through business -- for example, business companies for example, business patterns.
And these activities are wrong.
They allow them to allow these groups to increase their <unk> to increase their <unk> and build their <unk>
<unk> groups also do something else, create stronger with their population in order in social services.
They build schools, they build cars, they put them into a professional programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to measure the population we will make something that the state is not going to be not the safety of the <unk>
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan -- <unk> for war or even the beginning of the <unk> you can create the efforts of these groups to provide security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, the safety has a private price for the population.
But, in general, provide social services, it means to fill a <unk> a <unk> gap for government, and it allows them to these groups to strengthen their power.
For example, the distribution of 2006, <unk> cannot be able to recognize the social work.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when you look at the <unk> groups we just think in the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the vision of the long term.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they <unk> <unk> <unk> by government, and you have to be able to be <unk> and political groups are engaged in the <unk> and <unk>
And the more complex and complex are these babies, less we can be <unk> as a way to a state.
How would you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a <unk> <unk> all of their <unk> <unk> the <unk> system.
It's a <unk> It's a <unk>
Or maybe it's something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines is <unk>
We live in a world of states of the world, and we live in a world of the East world, as in the Middle East -- as in the East the Middle East and <unk> that gap of the <unk>
This is important for governments, because to stop these groups will have to invest more in the <unk> tools.
<unk> that software of government has to be in the center of any sustainable brain.
This is very important and also to build and <unk>
If we understand the best of the <unk> groups -- you see better what incentives to provide the transition of violence to violence.
In this new layer of states between states and <unk> <unk> the military power can win some <unk> but we don't have to give them a peace in the military <unk>
So to get these goals we need to move over the long time to fill out that artificial hydrogen and to fill that software of government that allowed these groups to live in a beginning.
Thank you.
I am a failure as a woman and as well.
My opinions about gender gender equality are <unk> but I fear that to accept the <unk> <unk> it would be building for <unk>
I'm <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I would get it as a bad time.
Or at least, I wrote a hole and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in the electrons of the electrons people started to call the <unk> <unk>
So what it started like a personal joke was forced to me and a <unk> <unk> has become something more big.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young about all in my age and the 20 years, I had very strange ideas about the <unk> these women are <unk> <unk> with the men and that we get the sex.
Today, I see how people are <unk> women in all the world and the anger, in particular, it seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But in the time, I was worried about the tone that was using people to the <unk> that could be a long time.
It will be <unk> as a feminist was a <unk> word -- a simple word.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't look at the rules, which is not still the rules, which is going to believe that it's like or lower to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
With the time, as I went on, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also, just proud of it.
For me, certain people are <unk> women are used to men.
<unk> the same time for the same work.
We have right right to travel around the world as <unk> <unk> or violence.
We have right right to use it to be easy to be easy and accessible and <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies without need to provide <unk> or <unk> <unk>
We have the right to the <unk>
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to have our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender religion -- religion and <unk> and a lot more more.
We have to have to have to have these differences and how we get it out of the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our Alpha is not anything.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be <unk> I'm a mess.
I'm full of <unk>
There's a lot of things that make me a bad time.
And I have another <unk>
When you look at work, I hear music <unk> <unk> <unk>
Although the letter goes to women and <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality with your <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I am completely <unk> by my favorite <unk>
I think I think in the work of the man, which is all that I don't want to do, <unk> -- -- all the tasks -- but they also also kill insects, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have nothing to see with it.
<unk> is my favorite color.
<unk> from the <unk> <unk> and the good things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have <unk> <unk> of the stories that they make reality.
Some of my <unk> are more <unk>
If a woman wants to take the last one of his husband, it's their choice, and I'm not who to preserve
If a woman decides to stay in home to raise their kids, they don't know that choice, as well.
The problem is not that it gets sex through this same choice, the problem is that our society is that our society is a way that our women are <unk> and when they were <unk>
So I got this problem.
<unk> <unk> <unk> which has <unk> or <unk> the needs of the color, the <unk> and <unk> the needs of color, the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> women -- <unk> <unk> <unk> of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of half
It turns out if that's good LT: I'm a very bad.
It's also going to be this: I feel a lot of <unk>
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we are going to be able to get it to the same.
When we put them out the <unk> with a lot like the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I've said, I'm a <unk> I think about that <unk> before you try to get there.
<unk> women, particularly the <unk> and the leaders leaders have afraid to be <unk> as <unk>
They have afraid to put up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> by afraid that it means that <unk> to fear of fear to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
Take an example to <unk> or like I call the <unk>
In the last years, it's a <unk>
In the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> before the word.
It was a show you know, you see this star of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and to make women and the young men who will be feminist is something to be born.
<unk> the time, the cultural experience, they started <unk> <unk> if you <unk> it was not just a long time.
<unk> their <unk> instead of just to believe the word of a <unk> woman and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> because we're still fighting a lot of a lot, we need so much, we need so a lot of a lot.
Let's go a lot more beyond the <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of any woman, <unk> until it doesn't be anything.
We don't need to do that.
The wrong thing or more well, a more <unk> is the point of <unk>
But what happens to happen?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give you to the action and be a little bit more <unk>
If I hear music music <unk> I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more than a happy <unk>
And these artists will not go to the way to talk about women in their songs until you make the change change changing their own.
No doubt is hard.
Why has their music that is so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to make a worst choice.
But when the bad decisions is that it makes it it makes it it makes the most hard for women to make the equality -- the equality that all of us is and our responsibility.
I think in my <unk> of three and four years.
These are two girls <unk> <unk> and <unk> and also a lot of <unk> I want to grow in a world.
And where they were going to get them on the strong creatures that they are.
I think in them, suddenly the best choice is <unk> as something much more easy to do.
We can all take better decisions.
We can change the channel when a TV program is about sexual violence against women as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We can change the <unk> <unk> when we listen to women that they ask women like anything.
We can spend our money to go into the film in another part when the movies don't try to make women more than a <unk>
We can leave to support the <unk> and the <unk> where they choose to take their <unk> as <unk>
In any case, the men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to win in his hair to participate in his project, and I work with it, until you don't have a number enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you to work with you until your <unk> or its organization is more <unk> with a more <unk> range of <unk>
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to overcome the barriers to the <unk>
We are not <unk> <unk> with these <unk> <unk> these <unk> our aspiration are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of <unk> and wait that our decisions are going to go to the top of the people in the power of <unk> and <unk> and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can take great decisions, more <unk> to create a political change and significant.
We can also tell you with <unk> our <unk> well, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> being a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is really because of a lot of reasons, but I say, about all, because I was <unk> my voice was <unk> and <unk> I helped me <unk>
There was a band.
I call it <unk> to do what happened.
A couple of kids, when it was very young, and I didn't know that the kids can do this to a girl.
They tried me as if it was anything.
I started believing it wasn't anything.
<unk> my voice, and after all I don't get to believe that I could say something that might be wrong.
But I was <unk>
And I went to <unk>
I was <unk> in a stronger version of myself.
And the words of those women who could understand a story like me, and the women who looked at me and understand what it meant to me and understand what it meant to live in this world if you have the skin <unk>
And the words of the women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned to write as this, and then I learned to write as I itself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can have.
On the writing and the <unk> I also found that if I was a little bit a little <unk> another woman could hear it, and I see that any of us is the anything that the world is about telling us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve any thing.
And in the another, I understand the way that I'm just a woman.
I am a bad, I am a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, and what I do, you don't want to leave everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same.
I hope that all we can be a little bit about, when you need to be <unk>
Now after the last year, after the year of the year, <unk> kids in California had <unk> by having <unk> or by being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then took the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things that the <unk> is that the <unk> that can be <unk> for a child system -- it's one of the most smart diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this from the middle of the century, but many of the kids involved in the United century, but a lot of the kids were afraid of something that was not still <unk>
But a moment, it was not the article that I looked at the <unk> about autism and vaccines -- and it turns out by being a <unk> <unk> by the British <unk>
I don't think most smart scientists that the theory that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put them into their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the growth rate of autism in the time.
For the most part of the 20th century, the autism has been a very profound disease.
The few psychologists and you know, I had heard about she create all its professional life without seeing a single case.
For decades, the distribution of the <unk> <unk> <unk> so only three or four children for every 10 dollars.
But then, in the decade of 1990, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> to autism as a epidemic as if you could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not the intelligence what is that?
If you ask people from the <unk> <unk> <unk> what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to explain these numbers <unk>
But that kind of language didn't make a lot of the fears of a young mother that is looking for the face of his son of his son of his son of two years ago, the visual technology.
If the <unk> <unk> they had to <unk> why they were so <unk> by what they were so <unk>
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to see with the fast progress and <unk> from science that with the <unk> power of <unk>
For the most part of the 20th century, the doctors talked a story about what autism and how it was <unk> but that story turned to be <unk> and the implications of the same are having a common impact in the global health health.
There was a second more complicated story of autism who had lost and found in the dark and found in the dark <unk>
This second story tells us all about how we came here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> published a article that describes 11 people who looked at 11 people who seemed -- <unk> worlds <unk> to the people from their around, even their own parents.
They could try to take a little bit about hours you take the hands to their neighbors -- but they were <unk> from <unk> by <unk> as when you don't know their favorite cell and the favorite <unk> in their favorite place without know them.
In the base of the <unk> patients in their <unk> <unk> <unk> that autism is very weird.
For the decade of 2003 like the main authority of the world in the issue, where I had seen less than 150 years of its <unk> as <unk> <unk> of places like South Africa.
And this is actually not <unk> because the <unk> <unk> for autism of autism were very <unk>
For example, you can take that diagnosis to children with <unk> but we now know that the <unk> is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had become nine percent of every 10 kids sent to their office to be <unk> without giving a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart, but part of their theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a way of <unk> <unk> caused by parents and <unk>
And these kids, he said, <unk> have been <unk> in a variety of <unk>
At the same time, without <unk> I noticed that some of their young patients had a special skills that we will do, in certain areas like music, the mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could choose to distinguish 18 <unk> before the two years.
When his mother put one of their favorite <unk> he says, <unk>
But it was <unk> I had a bad opinion of these skills -- which things as the kids were just <unk> what they had heard of their parents <unk> <unk> to win their <unk>
As a result, autism became the source of shame for families, and two generations of young kids who were sent to institutions for their own well, it turns into the world in general.
LT: I was not to the decade of <unk> that the researchers started to test the theory, theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I thought that the theory of mothers <unk> <unk> was pretty <unk>
She and his husband was John <unk> and <unk> and they had a very profound kid called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl like <unk> without education, and without access to other resources without a <unk>
To defend the National Center that they had more resources for the <unk> <unk> and their families, <unk> and his colleague 2007, engineers decided to do something that would be done 30 years before.
It would be a <unk> study of autism in the general.
<unk> a glass of London called <unk> to try to find the children they were <unk> in the community.
And what they saw was clear that the <unk> model was too dangerous, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and <unk>
Some kids could not talk about all, as the other they were <unk> in the <unk> for the <unk> in dinosaurs or the <unk> of the <unk>
In the other way, these kids are not going to be <unk> and <unk> as he said, <unk> and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model would have seen it.
At first, they were all all of trying to give your data.
How no one didn't have been able to be able to get these children.
But then I found <unk> I found a <unk> to a article published in Washington, in <unk> the year of <unk> and then it was <unk> <unk> under the <unk> of a terrible time that nobody wanted to be.
<unk> I knew about this article of MIT, but I was able to be <unk> in their own work.
There was not even a translation of the English but luckily, the husband of <unk> talked about, and he was <unk> for it.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who took a space associated with a high school with a high school in the 1950s,
<unk> ideas for teaching children to teaching children in learning were <unk> even for the <unk>
The morning in their clinic started with music, and the children were all their games on the late.
In order to tell the parents to cause electricity, <unk> the described as <unk> <unk> in life that have been able to be able to support and building spaces, during the course of the whole life.
And instead of trying to try kids in their clinic as patients, we would call it their small friends, and they took them to help them in the development development of education that were especially right for them.
I said, <unk> saw autism as a larger version that took a wonderful variety of <unk> and <unk>
He believed that autism and <unk> <unk> were common and they have always been <unk> to look at the same aspects of this integration in <unk> known in rural culture, as the national scientific and the teacher <unk>
He was more there, even until the success in science and art, a scale of autism is essential.
<unk> and Sarah found that <unk> was wrong in which autism was <unk> as what the parents were <unk>
In the next few years, they worked in silence with the American British <unk> to create the <unk> of the clinic that they have called <unk> <unk>
On the end of the 80 and the principles of the '90s, their changes in <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> for one of the <unk> of <unk> for one <unk> and <unk>
And these changes were not made in <unk>
<unk> when I was <unk> and I published working out of <unk> these <unk> people from all the world you see an adult <unk> for the first time.
Before you get <unk> <unk> in which just a small <unk> <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> teachers and parents all the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, there were the first mental issues to use to protect autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that small circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his child.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the <unk> and the introduction of these studies created a network, a perfect storm of consciousness of autism.
The number of <unk> started <unk> at the same like <unk> <unk> and <unk> in fact that it was not that that people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and the services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> was going to tell the vaccines for the rise to the rise in the <unk> A simple, powerful, and <unk> story as bad as the theory of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If you know the present of the age of the age of the age of the age that one of every <unk> children in America are <unk> are one of the <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, the people who <unk> have come up in the Internet to go on the idea that are the <unk> to solve the idea that are <unk> by solving the term <unk> to celebrate the series of human growth.
One way to understand the <unk> is thinking about terms of human systems.
The fact that a <unk> doesn't work with <unk> it doesn't mean that it's <unk>
According to the <unk> of the <unk> the normal human brain is easily <unk> <unk> <unk> and they have to be in a attention to the details.
All of all, the <unk> people have difficulty to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still going to find that the <unk> for the most <unk> issues of autism are found in the understanding of the <unk> <unk> and the parents and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A white woman called <unk> <unk> said a while, you want all the hands in covered to <unk> the <unk>
As we put it into a <unk> future, we need all the ways of human intelligence in the planet to make the challenges that face as society.
We can't afford to be able to afford no brain.
Thank you.
