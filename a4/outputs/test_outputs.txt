You know that what I do is to write for the children, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for children more read in the United States.
And I always tell people who I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> as a farmer, or with clothing clothing and never no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is usually something that fell in somewhere.
You just have to turn back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the <unk> in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I went to bleeding bleeding every week in the bathroom bath until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life at letting me go into the bathroom in the teachers.
He did it in secret it.
For three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California, in San Francisco, I found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to begin to work in organizations fought against AIDS.
About three or four years, half of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that we have never come to know about.
You could go to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you've been found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer and I'd like you to get you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
So we went to see, we were <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found out a place, the <unk> and we took them out of her family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because of it.
It's something we knew how to do.
And so as the woman I wanted to do is as an adult came to <unk> it became a box of <unk> and he was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save it.
And you know that part of life needs all the rest of your life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- it needs <unk> love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express humans not separated from nature, and it's all interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what I was in front of me.
I put them up to my <unk> about 60 feet, and I couldn't more than thinking that it was about a <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers or break down the walls.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and hold up to the end, whereas others can't <unk> more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated from eating and yourself, as much as we see ourselves as human humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a little <unk> I am breathing his <unk> atmosphere.
As a eardrum as a eardrum release water sweet water, in minerals that feeds a lot of life in a way of life.
I get to photograph these <unk> as if it comes to the portraits of my ancestry, knowing that in these single moments exist in that way and won't come back to exist again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of his way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last photos I would like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's a little frequent to actually witness a <unk>
Here it is.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is there there.
This is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> about 120 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same moment, every one of you -- a baby.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to go too much in the details of conception, because if you stop to think about the concept in it, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome is attached to the X X <unk>
And in the other case, the X X of the sperm is attached to the X X <unk>
Both of them, and it starts to start alive.
We're going to talk about them later.
In my ground activity to do two of them.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training, and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- -- -- that of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body, the idea of the <unk> what have thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've been working with people whose physical characteristics, challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with twin twins two people within a same body.
I've been working with people with <unk> people that the average average.
And I've been working with a lot of people with sex sex -- individuals whose physical expansion doesn't fit into male <unk> and conventional women.
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> adopted a lot of forms.
I'm going to put a few examples of ways of having a sex that doesn't be <unk> in the common forms or <unk>
So for example, there is the case of the individual <unk> <unk> whose gene <unk> of the chromosome and says to the <unk> that we all have in <unk> life.
And then, in <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But since this individual has no receptors in testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's the <unk> syndrome.
So, there are large levels of testosterone but without the reaction.
So as a consequence, the body develops to the course of a sudden <unk>
When you take the baby you have a little bit of a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not about puberty, but until puberty, when it's growing up and developing the breast -- but it doesn't have the temporary period when someone realizes that something is going on.
And then they realized that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's not really like this.
Women like men, as men, we have in the body something called <unk> glands, <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
The areolar glands, produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most of the women as I -- I -- I think a <unk> woman doesn't know their structure -- I think it's a typical woman, most of the women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, somebody like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has the <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
So sex is something complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a way, you can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19 boy born and raised as <unk> I had girlfriend, and sex with her, he had a life like boy and I had just found out that I had <unk> and <unk>
I had a extreme form of disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had the 20th of the 20th of the <unk> the <unk> glands, they were so active that, in essence, creating a male hormone environment.
So as a consequence, their genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically the male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> nothing.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors found that in fact, it was a woman in it.
Well, another example by a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th century, they develop what's known as <unk> is to say, have tissue <unk> wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are a lot of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies have to be <unk> twin twins or <unk> <unk> surgery -- not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why they go to various surgeries is that they're a threat for our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity <unk> being black means to be the African anatomy in historical terms.
A very simplistic.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different -- we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the <unk> very romantic.
Imagine the amazing thing that you have kids born as two people within a same body.
The most recent case is last year in the past year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> on the web in the <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called to wonder, "What are you going to do to determine if you <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to them to reporters that there is no test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we need to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> are us who we play that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we get into science, more we need to admit that these categories -- we thought were <unk> <unk> categories that are <unk> directly with <unk> categories -- are much more <unk> than we <unk>
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race -- something that turns out a lot more complicated than the terminology <unk>
So as we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we put it in science we go further and more and more in a uncomfortable zone where we need to recognize that <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all of the scales of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles to the beginning and the end of the life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> arguments today -- not in public, but I know within <unk> about when someone considers killed.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this issue of whether someone was killed.
As a lot of you put a pen in front of your nose and if you moved it to still <unk>
If I stopped moving it out.
But we can, for example, we get organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we need to deal with a dilemma of understanding the death, and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories would be able to be able to make somebody like me.
In politics I'm <unk> <unk> to people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I get nervous.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about me?
<unk> from the concept of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, that I find me every so looking at that piece of music <unk> <unk> and not for music, which is totally <unk>
That's why I happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> were to me, the first <unk> activists in the anatomy and explain it why.
What they would do, it was a <unk> concept, and I would plug it with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what our parents do, <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
<unk> of the old world didn't know about DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right to <unk>
They had the concept of blood <unk>
They were from the idea that it was going to be the political power for the right of the left of the grandfather to father and then to the son, etc.
So I put them up with this idea and replace it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They took the field of play, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, that was something really radical stuff.
And in part they were doing it because it was part of a system that was <unk> in which they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time we would make the science.
And it stays very clear, if you look at the story of <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> out of <unk> explanations and thereby <unk> the concept of being able to be transmitted by a <unk> idea of <unk>
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And a result, we were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And at doing so, they were <unk> the bases of the future of <unk>
They didn't think about that way, but did it for us and it was awesome.
And what happened years next?
And the women.
And then the success of the Civil Rights movement, with people of the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man.
And again, people of color that we go through the <unk> <unk> about the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at <unk> we need to start asking asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights than a human.
I don't want to say that we should go to anatomy.
I don't want to say that at the age of five years should allow you to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me have sense, and I think we should <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep it and if they make meaning.
Well, let's go back to those two things <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
So let's imagine that one of them, Mary, was three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, was was born in term: was was born on the March of 1980.
By the fact that we have been born three months before Mary are attributed to all three months before Henry <unk> right to <unk> <unk> the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because they have a different light, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> relative to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man -- it's <unk> from the <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, for his part, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all the states, for example.
Henry can get married in all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So there are still <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went so much in the field of the anatomy that we came to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give up science but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we going to go here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we need to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people stays caught in a weird position.
For example, Texas at a time has decided that to get married with a man don't have to have a chromosome and to marry a woman you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice, they do not test exams.
But this is also very weird given to given the story that I told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
If we look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I would say to <unk> it provides a solution.
It says that we should judge people who are <unk> not in the color of their skin but in the content of their <unk> going beyond the anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea seems very good."
But in practice, how do you do?
How do you judge people based on the content in your <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we need to do it in this for <unk> rights to people, because I've admit that I know about some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know may be able to make more decisions, smart and <unk> about their sex relationships that people from 40 I know.
So how do you put the subject of the content of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me is asking what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States will continue to drive this current technology of thinking about the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're doing good work in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is sensitive to being killed, unless it's willing to be willing to have a change of sex, in which case you allow it to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the one of a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made light twins <unk> to then pick them up, and so <unk> her <unk>
But when the phone asked the reason the reason I asked the subject of the surgery, he said to me that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and so I had to do it.
So I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum rather than <unk>
The United States provides huge possibilities to people who are not <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to end up I mean, I've been talking a lot of <unk>
And I want to think about how it would be democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given greater participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a <unk> and it is that I think there can be different ideas coming from different <unk> in particular, if there are people thinking about <unk>
Since years ago, I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in looking at the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has interested me are the differences between men and women in the way we think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and dealing with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers that I knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I thought <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most silly question I've ever heard.
feminism has to do with rid of <unk> stereotypes -- so there's nothing <unk> in <unk>
But the more I thought about her question, most of it has similar to me in the <unk>
I mean, that there might be something -- on average, something different between the physical brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very challenging to find the way to protect people in the state, it's possible that there were more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And perhaps that's what we need to do in the future when we take democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more in relations.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> we think about what we do about each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family think about where they want to go live and work -- has the possibility to choose between at least a bunch of different cities that are competing to attract new needs.
Well, at this point we're far from that goal.
There are thousands of millions of people in developing developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth a lot more than their building cost of construction.
So we could easily deal with the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this might sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But just <unk> by the buildings of apartments.
So imagine that half of the ones who would like to live in apartments -- they were already and that the other half still <unk> to do it.
They could try to increase the capacity to make <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that you think about is that those buildings and areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the <unk>
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place to build a completely new, totally new, always and when the norms of that place we would have to get <unk>
So I proposed that governments would make new market zones for huge <unk> cities and gave them a name under <unk>
I later found out that more or less at the same time, and I was thinking about the challenge of Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75 people would get out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same stuff in Honduras.
In the summer of the 2009 <unk> it happened for a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the following election, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which we <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked him to <unk> it was her boss of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was setting up a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a huge amount of tests with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most incredible ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say you can't go and pick all the current residents in apartments.
We need a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like rules for <unk> and usually they're the norms that keep us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala, gave him a link to the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They call.
They said, "Let's get this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we sat out in Miami in a conference room of a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And he used this picture that shows the value of the ground in a place like New York <unk> land that in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in terms of very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are coming up there and an option for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country will move forward.
He asked me to go to <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented to another talk full of data, which included a picture like this, that I tried to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city -- you have to start with a site to measure at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat up and showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option of a city that they might be going to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to the North.
And also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government, they would benefit from countries -- they could benefit from the countries associated that would benefit and make the norms of the <unk> so that they could all rely on that <unk> actually <unk>
We were and we saw a site.
This picture is from there.
It could take a few thousand square miles.
And shortly later, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional disposal that would allow us to create these special regions of development.
In a country that I had just gone through this financial crisis, the vote in Congress to favor this constitutional constitutional <unk>
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
For <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
The 17 of February was passed again in another <unk> to <unk> to one.
Immediately after the <unk> of 21 to 24 of February, a quest for about 30 <unk> was to the two places in the world that are more interested in engaging in the building of cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that is building in North Korea.
All you see there was built in four years, after you spent four years to get the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this so practical, this is the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're already thinking about a second city.
They're setting up a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and the time would allow to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allow their Supreme Court to be the court court to this new <unk> system.
There are <unk> and builders, cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you've solved is that you have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that would like to go in the <unk> especially in a place with a free area zone and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to turn it up to another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to let their family go back to their family to go to get a job, sometimes they have to win the money for just eating or buying clothes.
Sadly, sometimes there are kids who are trying to get together with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all around the world?
What does it look like to be <unk> so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> asked me to say, "Thank you a TED one.
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what is inside, I'm going to make a real <unk> and it's that, I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, I love to find, and more recently, photograph and publish my blog suits, colorful and different for every occasion.
But I don't buy anything new.
All of my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and shops.
Oh, thank you.
<unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I'm going to meet people who are passionate about how general my money goes to a good <unk> My view is <unk> and buying it into my personal quest to <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be from my size?
I'm going to love color.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
Going back to the subject of my <unk> I want to tell you what I would do, for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings you to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of <unk> and nothing else.
<unk> on exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else I would like to use after you got to <unk>
And because I don't know about the woman who walks up for TED in <unk>   that means that I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the drawing for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe or not, I've learned in this journey of not using new clothes.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger tiger here.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see OK.
You can almost see a great thing for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I ever used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be impossible to be a bad mood, when you're wearing a brilliant red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a long time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk>
Just yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not just <unk> you also <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember their little seven of seven years.
I like <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look good with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't look at it with something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inside and outside, you don't look at it that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal universal truth for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style and only is a cool way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it again and again when people came up with me this week simply because of what I was doing, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is obviously not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I left home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate it.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to put back certain things.
I don't need <unk> emotionally to these things, because back in the corner, there will always be another crazy <unk> <unk> and bright <unk> if there is a little love in my heart and I go.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a plan of our brain.
For example, this would be a <unk>
This would be absolutely intuitive.
So where is your brain going on this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists -- we need a lot of logic for <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need pretty intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same.
One of our intuition that you can have developed with the age of the years is that it says that one thing can be only at a place at the time.
I mean, it might sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you were not born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a child playing on a parking bar.
It was a small child, and he didn't do it very well, they always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that bar in parking parking bar, he taught him a valuable lesson, and it's that big things don't allow the <unk> and stay in a place.
This is a big conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a physicist physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars play with these small particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all sorts of things that are really rare -- as they can go through walls, or that they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of a few years ago; you needed from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects that surround us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and perhaps it's because I didn't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, no one saw a <unk>
But I didn't fit to my own logic.
Because if it's all made of small particles and all the particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't all follow the principles of <unk> mechanics.
I don't find the reason why I didn't have been.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also still follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see is in a overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip here.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to expand a little bit. It's just in the center.
And then here we make a big approach to a little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of a little bit of metal, with a sense of springboard and that <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way that I would do a computer.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a form of swimming <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in an overlap but so it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm in an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up with you to do those things, because I don't want them to be <unk> or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The coworkers of inanimate objects are not just people -- it's also the light that <unk> and the wind that goes on to its side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to get it to all the other passengers.
And that was what we did.
<unk> the lights and then <unk> a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and then we put it into a temperature of less than a degree at zero at all.
Now, as being just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act as he want.
So we measure their movements.
We discovered that it moved in very strange forms.
Instead of sitting perfectly still, still, and the way that we were <unk> it was like a breath in this form -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And when I give you a soft <unk> we were able to make it <unk> and that we don't go to the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean is that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about the atoms.
In one case, all of the trillion atoms that make that piece of metal are still and at the same time that those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's only in particular <unk> when those <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little bit of metal is more or less the same than the difference between that little piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, this is my logical part of speech.
So imagine if they were in various places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you acting your awareness if your body is <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we put it up, and we turned out the lights and look inside the box, we saw that metal still in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects in the elevator actually only are quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot of a lot about that quantum mechanics is that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are. And that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my boss who's here and he allowed me to take it out.
It took me 18 and 18 months.
A lot of negotiations and stories, and I would get it with 17 museums very interesting in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story explains simply in this slide and this is access to it.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- I didn't tell me, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and art art.
So when I started traveling and go on, I started to learn a lot.
And working at Google, I try to make the desire to do more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So better than it shows you the demo to then explain a couple of interesting things that we've done from their launch.
So, let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
It's the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In fact, I'm going to go into one of my favorite favorite, the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways of doing it -- very easy.
We can click on it, we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and you get <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top, and with one click click on it.
They're inside, that you want to go at the end of the hall to the end.
And keep it forward to <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk>
If the museum shows you the picture, we click there.
See, this is one of the pictures.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've been captured in what we call technology <unk>
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million dollars.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get with 10,000 million dollars.
You can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression.
But if you really want to be <unk>
So I started to play, and I found myself with something that was going on there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I found out that children were actually playing something.
And it was a little bit, I talked to some people in the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick, the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get into depth and see that you can actually get to the cracks, even in the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the picture, so you'll see what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're rapidly going to jump again at MoMA in New York.
Here another of my favorite favorite, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find a details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It increases it and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm actually going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I had never seen that before.
I'm going to show you another of my favorite function.
There's a lot of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely all, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can actually create their own museum, create his own collection from all these pictures.
It's very simple, we walked in, I've created this function that I call "The power of the <unk> -- -- we just got a step around it.
It's about "The <unk> in the National Portrait Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even not come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium do justice to their work of art, and that is represented properly online.
And the great question I'm doing today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to <unk> experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everyone.
I have something to show you.
So think it's a <unk> <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I am in Italian, all the children in Italy are growing up with this picture in the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting in the racing race in the last two decades.
Now some time, if you wanted to win a year to make a half one, one took a budget and put it into a good pilot, and a good car, a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the career.
This is what we engineering, in engineering, the control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that basic control systems are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronic networks.
They're becoming computers in the air.
And as <unk> are starting to answer a different way and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are coming into our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the late <unk> during the late <unk>
It's called <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms get sensors and <unk>
And that is changing by complete the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says that at the end, he took the hammer and he threw it up to the Moses --  -- you still can see a little <unk> <unk> and said, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and what didn't you say?
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection of the cure.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our laboratory.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup the year.
Maybe some of the remember, they would be Italy and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day looking at activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The point of time is on the top.
At the late early early afternoon, there are people over here and there doing <unk>
It starts the silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick call and it goes to the toilet.
Second time. End of time.
First of the last time I took a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She earns Italy, yeah!
That night everybody went to <unk> to the center.
There's the big peak.
The next day everybody went to the middle of the British team and the first minister of minister then.
And then all the world <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the age of <unk> people will <unk> it's a big party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how we can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another example of <unk> it's not about people, but things we use and we use.
Today we know all about the knowledge of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make a Mac, how do they <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift through the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year, to label what they were <unk> different kinds of things, like you can see, things that all forms of <unk>
And then we put a little chip, a tag on the trash and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
These are data that before not exist before.
They're going on complicated things, and there's a lot of transportation transportation.
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup is that we stop not going on, it's still somewhere on the planet.
And if the plastic plastic that we stopped a day is still still there.
And if we show that to people, then we can promote some change change.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and many other things really cool that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked to the beginning, which is to move on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city that came up and told us that Spain and the south of Europe, have a beautiful tradition of the water in public spaces in public spaces.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a garage, was, imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> vacuum valves.
It creates like a spring of water, with pixels of water.
If you fall down the pixels to be written in them, I'll show patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain opens up so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked him a lot.
And we took a commission to design the <unk> of <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There are no windows no windows but when you get to come to you that you can make it happen.
The roof is also covered by water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like in this case.
And there will always be someone, in the winter, when you go down the roof -- somebody who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you lower all the architecture goes away.
This is how it is.
You see people who are going on in the inside.
And here I am myself trying to do not <unk> when the sensors open the water.
I think I should tell you what a night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a bit.
It was no longer a building that would be open to leave you -- but a building that I kept doing <unk> and holes of water and one had to jump to not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think of use that people will give our designs.
But then that's always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physicists, the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
So imagine that they could have small helicopters in the air, and each one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that is moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw before, which is moving with other in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration.
Or, but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of the air.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could a cloud of pixels in 3D, where you can get closer and <unk> and see from very various <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light, the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine every one of them for a person.
We can have every pixel with a input that comes from people, and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of ballet today, the star of the <unk> of New York and the <unk> of <unk> to capture their online movements and use it as a input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left -- you see the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> as a movement capture.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can travel all the way.
And once we have the pixels to play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment <unk> like a farm <unk> like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
So imagine that we could make all of them <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we go from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything as knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is we <unk> we can move from the digital world of the power of the networks, from the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may be we wanted to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people do this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but it's covered with <unk>
You can move inside, having different experiences.
You can see it from the bottom -- serve to share the main moments of the London Olympics of 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but most important is that being a new experience for anyone to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what they are?
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, they could improve the <unk> for a more appropriate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in the way, be stronger to have a <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and sure of ourselves?
What about living more with good health?
Or maybe be of those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most thing that I <unk>
What would you wish if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people will tell creativity?
Raise your hand.
<unk> You probably had the number of creative people present.
That's really good.
How many would <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
What about <unk>
Oh, most of us, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it might be possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> topic here at the TED conference but today I want to give you a doctor on the topic.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> in addition to the <unk> Church, <unk> wrote an essay called "No <unk> <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution consider this: it's only about the past, or the future?
It comes to the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well in an end, is, of course, the most interested.
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
There have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually in its majority the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium, to produce the human insulin protein that's used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, it's the same <unk> that comes out of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all get in the <unk> more bacteria than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> you ask you about the <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully pragmatic environment for those bacteria.
It's hot, dark, technically, it's very <unk>
And we're going to give you all the nutrients that you can want to want to want to have no effort.
It's really like a quick quick way for the bacteria in the occasional <unk> somehow <unk> towards the way.
But, of course, we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients and protect us from certain disease.
But what would we tell us the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as species?
Or to become something different, something probably better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast <unk> <unk> of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single <unk> and only human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk that I hope you have <unk>
When I just went to college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in <unk> organisms every cell simply is <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two small cells.
But when we look at the <unk> organisms -- things start to change.
It leaves the sexual reproduction.
And something very important: with the onset of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, one might say that the <unk> of the death death of the body comes in evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction at the same time.
I have to warn you that when I was a college student I thought -- well, <unk> <unk> death for <unk> it was quite reasonable at the time, but every year that was happening, every time I was more <unk>
I was going to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in their late late years.
And one night somebody hits her home door to the hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him, you find a magnificent <unk> <unk>
He looks at it and says, <unk> in search for a <unk> <unk>
He said, "Well George, says <unk> <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to make us healthy.
I wanted to restore health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is about spending the genome to the next <unk> adapted and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like rockets <unk> designed to send the genetic load to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think we all <unk> the feeling that <unk> Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality.
I want to warn you, not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily prevent longevity.
Not necessarily <unk> the biggest or the stronger or the faster or the faster and even the smarter.
Evolution favors creatures better adapted to their environment.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish, <unk> fish, yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase. I would say there are a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that we don't.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the math reasoning would be that by medicine, in the first place, we've learned a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and cut from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to help us as well as we adapt to us.
And by the way, we <unk> <unk> and we will tell us so much that it's not possible to have the isolation of the evolution.
A second possibility is that you make a evolution of the natural kind of kind -- natural kind of dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as much as <unk> as a kind of <unk> planets are going to exist in isolation, and the environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there is a third possibility a greater and intriguing possibility.
I call it the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and <unk> for us as individuals in the choices that we want.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First, let's first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but that's what is choosing to the individual and family level.
Think also if it could be able to choose not only the sex of their <unk> but in their own body -- genetic modifications to heal or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's disease to reduce cancer or eliminating <unk>
Don't want to make those changes in your genes.
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project.
<unk> billion dollars.
The next year of being done, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome to a cost of close to 20,000 and a week.
Not a lot of a lot to make the human genome for <unk> and becoming more and more and more than all of us all.
They come out of those change.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that aren't only going to protect us but they're going to induce immunity.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in course with the flu vaccine in cells from a gas plant.
Can you imagine something good about the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine one other little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the egg <unk> and give your children a better chance of a more healthy life, to eliminate diabetes, to remove the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases that are going to allow us to take <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't we have the genius of an Ken <unk> especially if I could <unk> with the next generation of the <unk> machine.
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allows us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't we live more time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we want to become the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally might take a hundred years and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next hundred years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to get them to them.
We're going to use these choices for a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to pick up different attributes that we want to do for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring, and more uniform or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question that we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing to all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and the <unk> wisdom to take these <unk> decisions.
For evil, or for evil, and before I could <unk> these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a <unk> seat that day I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight.
So I immediately looked at it, and they said, "There is no problem." We probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot, <unk> the airplane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the road.
<unk> the motors.
Imagine being on a plane and without <unk>
And then said three words ...
The most <unk> words that I've heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight.
I could see it in your eyes.
The life was terror.
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before you die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get out and I didn't know it, all the fences that I wanted to get to <unk> all the experiences I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I was thinking about that later -- I came up a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll open.
I don't want to warn you, nothing in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the George Washington Bridge that wasn't for much -- I thought about, Wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and with my errors I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also led to my <unk>
And I'm sorry that the time you do in things that I know matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then as <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
You feel <unk>
I don't try to have <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing that I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
See the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to break on 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, Wow, she will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to tell you, I love my life.
And that sorrow is <unk> in a single thought, which is just a thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> as a child.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
In that point, I understood that the two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great dad.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad.
He gave me a miracle to not die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the chance to look at the future, and to live in another way.
You know, you're flying up today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens in your airplane -- and please not be this -- but you can imagine, and how do you <unk>
What do you think about doing because you think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change your relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents that we want.
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the most cool thing that I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the early 1980s.
One day came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today <unk> has a total paralysis of hope.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design and animation company, so obviously the graffiti is something <unk> we admire and <unk> in the art world.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I sat up with her brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me?
And I said, "A second, it's not that <unk> saw Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody important, and you have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Anybody seen the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, you go to the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented with the only desire to deliver a check, and rather than that signed a check that I didn't have the idea of how I was going to <unk>
I would get bored with his brother and with her father there at that very moment, so on, "OK, this is the <unk> Tony is going to speak, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who has so much on their inside can't be <unk>
So I talked about a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research who have a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer draw on that and record negative space.
So they go out there making art facilities like this.
All the things that we do, they say, are part of a life cycle.
First of you start with sexual organs then with bad words, after with the Bush attacks and, at the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so I started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of the organization and a lot of moving things out of one side to another side of one side to another couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of safe companies, and we got a machine to make it <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was cool.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call him <unk> because when I talk to the guy you get an email email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all the corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, moved to the garage of the back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> they took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought that we would do something totally stupid and that when I was <unk> they would have taken out the frames out of the walls, and in its room there would be <unk>
But for two weeks, we <unk> we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog as well, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of cheap chip that we buy on the <unk> <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We take a <unk> camera -- we put it on a light light, and now there's a device that's free -- and there's a device that is free -- we published the code <unk> software is low in <unk>
And we created a device that doesn't have limitation at all.
There is no insurance company to say <unk>
There is no hospital that can say <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate with just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you that was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the <unk>
I love this picture, because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There were all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning two weeks of programming successful sessions from all night, Tony came back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and is looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a slide on a wall on a wall of the hospital.
And he came to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling is in the <unk>
The funny thing was that we had to recruit in the parking spaces, so we felt like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email email and this was what we would say, "This was the first time it was a <unk>
I felt like I had been under the water, and somebody finally came to <unk> and I would take me out there so I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to travel with this.
It's a cool device but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we are trying to figure out how to make it <unk> and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
It's all coming out of our own pockets.
The prizes were the <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the best inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this, and this is what ends out of close the <unk> is that at April of this year in the <unk> of the Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> it's going to have the best <unk> of urban art.
<unk> is going to be in the show, which is pretty awesome.
So, basically this is my idea: If you look at something that's not possible, do it possible.
Nothing in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible.
Do you <unk> any thing in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with technology recognition technology, I simply recognized something and I would tell you with amazing people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do all the days when we find something that you have to do, if it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years, in situations usually very difficult and at the same time a little dangerous.
I went to the hard.
I worked on a <unk> mine.
It's in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just this fun fun at the beginning, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career, I've been <unk> in situations in the very horrible appearance with the only goal to try to look at social questions of ways that we make <unk> <unk> and, hopefully analyzing them in a way that they look very cool and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I was coming up here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> wanted to do something a little differently.
So some of you may have heard, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some of Twitter, I offered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What there was the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk in which you have no idea what it is and using content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridicule to you or your company to do it.
But he said this, it's a very good chance.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress.
So still with that <unk> I knew somebody would buy the rights rights.
If you would have asked me a year ago, I would not have been able to get it up for certain.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the marketing world of advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've got me in some horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> nothing could <unk> for something so difficult or as dangerous as you go into the rooms with these guys, with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that I try to make a film that I try to make the <unk> of product -- the marketing and the <unk> and that all the film is <unk> with <unk> of innovative and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The largest movie ever <unk>
What's going on in "The largest movie, ever <unk> is that all of the top at the bottom at the bottom -- it has images of brand, all the time from the <unk> that shows before the title <unk>
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all of this idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> It's <unk> A <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> Just <unk> It was more for <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the <unk> of the X <unk> in the title but we're going to make sure we give you all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe <unk> a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe you have <unk>
The most cool car that you ever take in "The largest movie, ever <unk> the best <unk> you have <unk> from "The largest movie ever ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, making it <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> MS: And we actually showed the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film was transparency.
You'll see all the process in this film.
That's the complete idea. It's all the film of the first end.
And I would love you to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's funny because it's the first time I hear -- it's the ultimate respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> it's going to be the people at that.
<unk> You've got a <unk> -- I don't know whether it's too <unk> but you know how it's going to <unk> <unk> I don't <unk> David <unk> How much money do you need to do this?
MS: One million and a half <unk> -- very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard the meeting with them, but certainly it's going to be worth deciding a couple of big conditions.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie is coming out of us as a lot of <unk>
MS: What do you think it's going to be the response?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> by the film or to be I?
JK: Both things.
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So I got to myself, I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk>
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where I'm going to go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: So I thought that <unk> meant we would have a conversation out of microphone.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And this was, one for one, all these companies were suddenly gone.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product to so much people as possible, to make so much people as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate, is not the idea to tell that new vehicle worthy of attention that's going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, that my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
Actually, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image is.
See, when you look for <unk> images in Google <unk>    -- this is one of the first images that came out.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> free of simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of the data, especially in <unk> practices -- being the last line perhaps the biggest line.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president, the <unk> even <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it something changes <unk>
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  like that weird bear, that still still still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare <unk>
And it's very risky.
What else is <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and telling you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want to be <unk> <unk> story.
We want you to take a story -- but you have to make it <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a child, and my father would tell me in some lie -- and there is him staring at me as I used to say, <unk> there are three sides in every story.
It's your story -- it's my story, and there's the story <unk>
You see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanted to help me -- and that was just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to remove the <unk> and go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to figure out of a sudden -- and I started giving me <unk> is that when you start talking with companies to understand your brand is universal.
MS: I've got friends who do big, enormous, giants and others who do small, independent films like mine.
And my friends who make films of big, giant Hollywood says that the reason that their movies have so much success is due to the marks that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well how are we supposed to compete with these big, movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest movie ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "You're cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little <unk>
I want you to help you that you <unk>
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there's one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their chance.
We're going to have so much to be a man like for <unk> solid, to <unk> on bar, like it.
That's the look at this.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk>
Karen ends) We are a small hand.
<unk> to the kind of small movies that we're going to do, we are more good at <unk>
So we don't have the budget that you have other brands.
So do things like that, you know, remind you to people is the reason why we care about it.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something new, cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category, in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you.
How do we keep you cool more time? With better <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the <unk>
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What is a common kind of guy.
I need to talk to the person on the street to people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good stuff.
Woman: reviving the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what is it <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> Man: So the kind of gender, that I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like dark colors, a lot of gray colors, and things like this.
I usually carry them as a Sun, or I like the crystals and the same ones.
Woman: If you were a brand a brand a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In a <unk> part of a <unk> part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the <unk>
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Spiderman 4: My brand is FedEx because I <unk> <unk>
Man Merckx <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand <unk> but I often get to <unk> on the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized that I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they were able to do it for them, you probably could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photographs, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings of it.
MS: These are a way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which we <unk> as the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work that you do.
All those things come out and start in a place and in my case and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What is the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: The next one is the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things, I like the weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> so what is that?
What's the <unk> What phase of <unk> you find right now?
Why is it important to <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> You've got <unk>
You don't have to be afraid of what kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you. No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience. Great <unk> A: <unk> Thank you very much.) OK.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
I had a lot of crazy all over this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of it, but it <unk> in your personality, <unk> <unk> brand is a <unk> brand.
They're very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies only would be <unk> in one of their strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot companies tend to be -- and it's the <unk> nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear -- those elements -- and you actually <unk> and you make some positive thing for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first one here is the classic Apple.
And you can see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands and brands -- those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: An <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to take your identity of brand, your personality of brand, what would be?
You're a <unk> <unk> You're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more <unk>
A little more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful to be cool as <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystical as <unk>
Or are you more of attribute <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're <unk> stable, familiar, insurance, sacred, sacred, or <unk> like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
It allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how they now use MRI resonance to identify the centers, in the brain as much as a movie as much as a film.
We went to St. Paulo where they have banned advertising at free air.
In all the city over the last five years, there's no <unk> no <unk> no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting on the way in schools with a problem with the U.S. issues in the United States.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects in which I've had the biggest answer or the ones that I've been more successful in which I would interact with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> to the <unk> took out to their <unk> and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about people who will challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has it left? They have success?
Well, since the film came out in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film came out in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a period of two and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online, it's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has been starting to win momentum.
And it's not wrong, because almost all the agencies that we talk about you with your clients not to be part.
I've always believed that if you take risks, that on those risks are having opportunities.
I think when you get to people of that is pushing people out of failure.
I think when you train your staff at the loss of risk is preparing all of your company for <unk> of rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, again, I think we need to get it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear -- <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to keep transparency.
Now more than a little bit of honesty is going to travel a long way.
And he said that, with honesty and transparency, all of my talk <unk> the <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> gave the rights to the name of <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So, <unk> in behalf of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: That's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check to the name of the National organization, the <unk> Foundation a check for <unk> to be applied to my assistance for the next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant, in <unk>
The gray boxes that see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that are controlled and <unk> we can have a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use software <unk> they're from completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective virus from Windows in a portable computer used by an engineer to set up this gray, then we are smart.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk>
<unk> comes into the gray box hurts the <unk> and the nuclear program is <unk> mission <unk>
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started to research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was absolutely unknown <unk>
The only thing you know is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> using multiple <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these parallel boxes, these control systems.
That came to us the attention, and we started an experiment where we had our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they went very strange.
<unk> <unk> as a laboratory rat who didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat it.
I didn't have sense for me.
And after experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
<unk> is looking at the gray box in the gray box, if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that's trying to infect is actually working on that place:
If no, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say for example, a power plant plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
So better than you can do it soon.
So we pulled out the attack code, and we found out that I was <unk> in two bombs.
We also found that they were armed with very professionally <unk> by people who obviously had all the internal information.
<unk> all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much they <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the <unk> of <unk> is complex, high technology, let me say, the load is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code code.
We're talking about about 15 lines of code.
It looks like old <unk> language.
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking for. was called the system of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and we tried to deal with the real world with potential goals of the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it has to be a <unk> white <unk> and it's certainly located in Iran, because it's where most infections.
It's not several thousands of goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear energy plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant of <unk>
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and plants of energy between our <unk>
I called them and asked them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
So rotor is that mobile part within the <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> you can certainly <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was making it slow and bugs in an obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very looking at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That had sense, there was a coincidence.
And it was better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find on the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of trust to understand what we had between hands.
So there was no <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been out of a number of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> would come to one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
<unk> small is taking a <unk> and doing <unk> and <unk> and <unk> big is communicating with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We shouldn't worry that other goals will be <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we saw really <unk>
There's the gray, and you see the <unk>
What this thing does is to intercept the stock values for example, from the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and provides <unk> code, which is still running during attack, with false data data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data are <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies, where during the <unk> the security camera is fed in <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> to the operators in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator would not be fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam turbine turbines goes on speed, you have to open tubes in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do a human cycle.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when you're <unk> then you can go through bad things.
The plant can explode.
And not the <unk> or the security system is <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work also, for example, in a energy plant, or in a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> <unk> like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology <unk>
We can make it more possible.
And if you made that, with what you think is with a <unk> of massive destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We have to deal with the implications, and better than we let us work now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has done public in many sides that people assumed that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved -- but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower here.
There is one itself, and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because, otherwise our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that you can carry on and give you a chance to make user chairs go back and go walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
It's nothing different from something that you put in the morning, gives you a big force that can also increase your speed, and help you help for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate and connect with the universe and with other <unk>
This is not an amazing idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back a <unk> load.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- lesions in the back 30 percent of the soldiers -- with <unk> damage.
We decided to consider this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk>
Soldier: With the <unk> <unk> I can give you a hundred pounds for the variables for many hours.
Your flexible design allows us to put it in <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the Internet users of the wheels, which I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in the chairs of the wheels, all over the world.
As one percent of total population.
And this is a really conservative calculation of it.
We talk about something that happens with often, very young people in the spinal cord that when you start their life -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide versus a wall and the chair is to be its only choice.
We also talk about the population that comes up very quickly.
Her only option, a lot of times -- for a cerebral injury or some other siblings.
And this has been so over the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start to write a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had a lesion at the <unk> column and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years, until now.
<unk> <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got some sensors.
It's completely not <unk> in crutches who send signals to the computer computer here on the back.
There's also some battery that give the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it forward with this very very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, by a weird leap in the air, skiing costs <unk>
In a fraction of the second, I lost every sensation and all of the <unk> movement.
I just got a time later, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> will never go back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole it up to the last little bit of hope that my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to learn how to <unk> it is down in <unk> climbing rocks and even ride in <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allows me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just by soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the chairs of chairs to all.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say, hi, and the game is the order of the day where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos of the Congo.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their closest living lives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too focused on this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimps are dominated by big, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special that this leads to a very tolerant society where death violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of great apes.
They live in the depths of the <unk> and it's been very hard to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that's been sustained for decades and caused almost so many deaths like the First World War.
It's no wonder that this destruction also put in danger of the <unk>
<unk> meat trade and deforestation do that you can't fill up or a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we aren't sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the red laughter <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as apes <unk> the love, not <unk> because they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to handle conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, like humans, I love to play throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a game.
For us and the game is critical to establish links and foster <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of behavior, diversity of behavior, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo sees the root roots of the laughter, the dance and the human.
So the play is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play you but I want to show you a couple of unique videos.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> <unk> and I don't talk about football game.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what is doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> has a <unk> of <unk>
I just think that in this case he love him, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual play is so much in Bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because we can take this video really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements of play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is of the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of ways -- some of which are more <unk> <unk> -- maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to take it up, this is <unk> a young female who is playing with <unk>
I think that as it do, sometimes we played by yourself, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity. which drives us to explore, to explore, and then the unexpected connections we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples from the understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we need to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's take the peak our capacity to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least appropriate play, they can be the moments where the most urgent thing.
So colleagues -- primates, accept this gift of evolution and play together as they <unk> creativity, the friendship and the wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling <unk> <unk> fires as a <unk> of captain in a <unk>
And in our city where volunteers refer to a highly qualified staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a pretty high chance to go.
But still, there was a race to the other volunteers to get to the captain to the captain and figure out what our job was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at complete night, she was standing outside the rain, under a <unk> in her <unk> while his house was on flames.
The other volunteer that I had just got to get before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>  he got first to the captain and he asked him to go back and would save the dog in the <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who I walked into a <unk> building to save a live living -- just because I made me for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go at home.
I need to be <unk> <unk> the fire, and bring it to this woman a couple <unk>
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but <unk> I went on the stairs, at the end of the hall, and went to the fire firefighters that at that height or less they had finished the fire and walked into the front fourth for a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load up the staircase where I met my <unk> and the precious dog on the front door.
<unk> out of the house the treasures for the owner of the house where, as it was to expect, his treasure. got a lot more attention than me.
A few weeks later, the department, got a letter from the owner of the <unk> home by the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at over the rest was that someone had reached even a couple of shoes.
Both of my calling at Robin <unk> like in my calling as a firefighter <unk> I'm witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of the acts of <unk> <unk>
And you know what I've learned?
It all has its importance.
So when I look at this room in the room to people who have achieved, or they're at <unk> remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: not wait.
Not wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to giving, <unk> now.
<unk> food in a <unk> <unk> a neighborhood park.
There are mentors.
Not all the days we're going to have the opportunity to save the lives of somebody but every day we're going to be able to influence someone.
So you go to the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, it comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This might seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the particular block.
The first concrete blocks of concrete is built in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules in a special measure that fits each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build more big things than us, as a buildings or bridges at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947 to <unk> came up with this.
It was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the building blocks came to all the home.
It's estimated that you've made more than 400 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or home.
<unk> did it open.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the labs, Bell, the next revolution was about <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> stacked around each other to a world where it was all interactive.
Just like the concrete block the transistor allows the transistor to create much greater circuits and more complex, a brick at the time.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was just for an expert.
I personally don't think that the building blocks of our time are being held to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of taking the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they're running together.
So you can't put it in a wrong way.
The building blocks have an colors.
The green is, the blue is the stream, the rose and the orange color is the wire there.
So only you have to assemble one blue in a green one, and very quickly you can start to make the older circuits.
An blue one is a green one.
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
You know, this <unk> to create more impact, and we have a little machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, we're actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using a very simple <unk>
To make it <unk> faster or slower or slower or slower or more slow, simply a button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a growing collection.
We want all the interactions in the world in the world <unk> to use.
<unk> sound, solar cells, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given <unk> to the kids to see with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of all the days that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light from night, or why the door of a elevator is holding open or how an iPod responds to play.
We've also taken <unk> to design schools.
So for example, designers without experience some electronics begin to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the <unk> School of Rhode Island, who don't have any experience of some engineering, just in cardboard and paper and said, "You know, something.
Here's an example of a project that have been made, a <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> made from dough that is afraid of the darkness.
For these didn't engineers, it became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be the scope of everyone.
So <unk> has open open-source.
You can visit the website, you can download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world is ours.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries today.
I work in the solar industry industry.
And my little business is to do to do that with the focus on focus on the environment.
distributed collaboration.
This is a small video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> We can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I have a term the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I released an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in a environment that represents almost everything that we're supposed to do, we asked them to work on the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> <unk> to <unk>
<unk> some members every year and put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of getting out to the Third World We send them into the wild world <unk>
They made great <unk> they worked with <unk> <unk>
Your job is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
At the age of the city of Boston.
Here comes up as if I would look at a quote, but what I really look for is that somebody got it when it stays on the snow, because he knows it's not very good by putting fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help for this very <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time we would spend a long last year.
They realized that the city never cleaned up these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else that citizens had to <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accepts <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, he put him <unk>
If you don't do, somebody can <unk>
I mean, it has a players' component.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest applications we have spent the last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the Afghan government.
And it stretches into viral.
An responsible system of <unk> city systems when you see this application realized that I could use it not for the snow, but for the citizens to have <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people will <unk>
So he begs the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago is just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks up.
So now we know about nine cities that we can use using it.
And this has been spread without <unk> in a natural and natural way.
If you know a little government technology will know that this doesn't happen.
The software process generally takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half <unk>
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their kids.
And then they told us that I had done for normal channels there would have taken at least two and a half million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there is a project in the power of California, which until the moment has two billion dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this on every level of government.
So an application that takes a program in a couple of days, and it spreads in viral form is a kind of shot of warning to the institution of the government.
It suggests to the best ways to work, not as in private companies, like a lot of people think it should be.
Nor do a technical company, but more like the Internet itself.
I mean, without constraints, in form and <unk>
And that's important.
But most important about this application is that it represents the way to deal with the issue of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an arbitrary institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out that we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we can go together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to apps with <unk> apps every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given by the government.
Do you have a great frustration to that but you don't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And it's that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that we put crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because I alone don't <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
Politics don't <unk> the government itself.
And given that the government at the last instance <unk> of us -- remember that from <unk> the <unk> the way we think about it will make change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make it <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, mostly about <unk>
This is the telephone care center of service and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you take <unk> in the United States.
Scott <unk> this call.
He <unk> <unk> at the basis of <unk> knowledge.
I didn't find anything. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, can you open the doors of home, put music and see if you <unk>
And it worked. So well by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a telephone center.
He's got an application, and mobile phone called <unk> <unk>
We don't hear that application.
It was the work of very smart people in the New York Bureau of Boston <unk>
One day, this really happened this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it for <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking to me.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I come up to the place, I found the Rubik's trash behind the house.
<unk> Yeah.
I went back the <unk> I went home.
Good nights.
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physicist.
And it's a great example of the government of the government to collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of platform.
I talk about a platform for people to be able to help others.
So a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
It connected to two people.
And it might have connected with the governmental services to be necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than the governmental services.
When one neighbor helps another, they would take the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we need to think about the government is that it's not the same thing that politics.
A lot of people <unk> but think you're the input of the other.
What our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government <unk> our values, our needs, but then we don't see change.
That is because the government is like a huge ocean, and politics is the shallow <unk>
On the bottom is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But this is that <unk> what keeps us that that is that we financed as something that is working on our against, that other thing, and in a consequence we are missing power.
People think politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work we will have to make that bureaucracy sexy.
Because it's where the real work of governance.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of governance.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They have <unk>
It's a group of citizens who have written a very detailed report of <unk> pages in response to the request of <unk> <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not political activism is activism <unk>
And so that we have <unk> to the government, it's time we ask us what world we want to leave our kids.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
They really believe that we have to go to where we need to go without solving the institution that can act in behalf of <unk>
We can't take out of government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and he knows that it's not so hard to act -- just to create the systems in the right way.
The age of age of our members is 28 years so I am, I am a greater generation than a lot of them.
This is a generation that's grown by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who are going to <unk> everybody will talk.
You can express your opinions in any channel and they do it.
So when you face the government problem you don't care about to hear their voices heard.
They're using hands.
They hand hands to work to program applications that do better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning a <unk> taking out of a <unk> taking a bucket of trash that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not just consumers, not only of the government consumer.
We are more than that.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get to <unk>
So I want to ask everybody, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, all together, we're going to be a crowd, we will also be a <unk>
Thank you.
This is to me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in the prisons, prisons and death penalty death.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are saying here are impact on the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have in a way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk>
So here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this on the law of the right my work.
I learned from my grandmother's grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional home of a <unk> family dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother's grandmother.
It was <unk> it was a strong power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia over the <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was <unk> but it was also <unk>
When I was small and looked at it, she was approaching me and gave me a good <unk>
It was so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to me and I would say, <unk> I still feel my <unk>
And if I told him that no, I would go back to me again and if I told him I was going to peace.
I had this human quality that would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the top 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to get their time and their attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and I looked at me.
At first I thought it was a game.
And I looked at him, and he said, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up in the room, and he took me out of my hand and said, "Come on. We'll go to it.
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget.
It took me out and said, "I'm going to tell you something, but you can't say <unk>
I said, "That's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now you know, <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget.
And then he said to me, "I want you to give me three things <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "I first want you to tell me is that you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to warn you that the <unk>
Like I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I <unk>
And then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell me is you're always going to do the right thing even though the right thing to be <unk>
I thought and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
Then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that I never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field in <unk> <unk> I've got a brother a older year and a sister a small year.
When I was 14,  15, one day my brother came home with a package of six <unk> I don't know where the <unk> grabbed us my sister and me and we went to the forest.
We just got the <unk> of the time.
He took a sip of beer, he gave her to my sister, she took a little bit and offered me me.
I said, "No, no, no. You're right, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> Today I do it. And you always do the same thing that we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Raise a <unk>
And I took it up with the <unk> and say, "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "What are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> says all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this will spread <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I never had a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I'm saying it for the power that the identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others who don't really look meaning.
We can't get to do things that they don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been prison during the <unk>
My whooping died of age-related age-related disease.
And these were the things that, according to it, we should <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different from what it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today there are 2.3 billion.
In the United States, we have the largest death rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive <unk> in my view, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities or black, it finds so much <unk> so much <unk> by these facts.
One of three black of the 18 and 30 years is in prison or a parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore Baltimore -- 50 to 60 percent of all young color are in jail or <unk>
Our system is not just distorted in front of the race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that comes to you much better if you're rich and innocent.
It's not <unk> it's wealth that affects the results.
And it looks like we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not our problems with us.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at us in our work some pretty curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you give you of rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, the <unk> of the black male population, has lost the right to the vote.
And if we put it back to the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights will be as much as it was before you get the law of the right to the vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent kids.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where the children of 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, no chance to go out again.
Now we're in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in the death camp.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a sense, you have to think that the ultimate question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There is another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty death penalty is defined by mistake.
In every nine people who have identified one which is innocent who is <unk> and liberated from death <unk>
A sign of error, <unk> an innocent rate of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would never be allowed to fly airplanes if every nine to <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we got to get it out of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> <unk> I'm talking about slavery.
I talk to you about terror, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that went up to the Second World War.
We don't really know a lot of this.
But for American Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what their lives defined their lives.
Now there are people who come up with me and tell me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teach <unk> <unk> to people who stop saying that in our history we deal with terror, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say I grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was obviously with twice and decades of racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic why we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we can do with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about <unk> I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that we couldn't overcome racial evolve without a compromise with the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this engagement, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving the death penalty <unk>
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's pretty disturbing to listen to what you want.
<unk> "We don't have death penalty in Germany.
<unk> We will never be able to be here."
The room stayed in silence and a lady said, "There is no way that with our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, <unk> and <unk> we could run the people."
<unk> about this.
How would we look at a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> to people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
That would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these hard issues, the positive and wonderful things are, though, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. We love creativity.
We love the entertainment.
But recently, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both.
Now, we've talked about the need to have more hope, more engagement, more dedication with the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the ones that will never come to TED.
You think about them -- in a way, something that's inside our self.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to <unk>
And the development with innovation, with creativity comes not just from brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also by the heart of the heart.
This kind of connection to the heart is what drives us to look at it not just in the brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader <unk> talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, the <unk> we wanted to do all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope to be the orientation for the spirit, a will to be in places of <unk> and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is essentially essentially in the heart of what I think even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design that allow us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> inequality, to the injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were getting together just to talk.
Occasionally, the lady -- I called me to say, <unk> comes the lady <unk> We're going to bring it to talk.
Do you want to come and <unk>
I would say, "I know I think.
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I gave him <unk>
So I would go and just <unk>
It was a very <unk> <unk>
And in one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mr. Parks came to me and said, "Now, thank you that this idea of justice justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to challenge injustice.
We try to help those who have been <unk>
We tried to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We tried to end up with the sentences of life, no freedom to support the kids.
We try to do something about death penalty thing.
We try to reduce the population in jail.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave you all my best speech, and at the end of me he looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> <unk> he put my finger on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very <unk>
I think actually the TED community has to be a lot more <unk>
We need to find the way we deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated on simple stuff.
I've come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher to the worst we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills another, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in people who should be <unk> by the law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and, certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> and we don't judge us for our technology, for our design or rational.
At the end, the character is, the character of a society, not because of how they treat rich and <unk> but in the way as they treat the poor, they <unk> them.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly deep issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make too much strength.
<unk> tired, like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a very important way.
I've been representing these kids who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to the prison and I see my clients in 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> to be <unk> as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge convert somebody in what is not it?
The judge would <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One night very late was <unk> <unk> God, if the judge can turn it into something that you're not, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a quarter of 14, a small, black.
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> who would say, <unk> for my black customer to be treated as a <unk> <unk> CEO of a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there there were some <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a sharp line about how in this country there's no ethical line, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had <unk> it had been sent to court.
About two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> my God, I have to go to court for this stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very hard and <unk>
I finally got down from the car walking to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man, <unk> was the <unk> of court.
When he looked at me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he says, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
So I went to me and <unk>
And I would tell you in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to help the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went to the <unk>
When you walk in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> I went to discuss.
People started to. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They've got the policemen <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people -- all <unk> because we were talking about <unk> because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I went to see the <unk> which was and <unk>
I would look at the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking up here and for there.
Finally, this old black black, I walked into the room and sat up in the room and sat behind me, almost on the lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
And for the <unk> an assistant of the <unk> he showed him <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant <unk> on the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood up, I looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, "Let's go to this room of audiences to tell this young man who would keep her sight in the goal with <unk>
I have come to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds up to justice.
We can't really be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and dignity.
What our survival is linked to the other of others.
What our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above top of all, to those of us who share this, I simply want to tell you that keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious question, I wish of the audience, in this community, of helping to do something.
Something that is not a check what can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close to you.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring where it will be an effort for <unk> the funds that are spending today in policy policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death penalty penalty penalty over the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of murder -- not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't go to nothing.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up to propose that these funds are <unk> to make the law of safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There have been a huge decline in <unk> in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it tells you that you have to do with the largest <unk> rate.
What would you say that you would say this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in massive <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's about the wrong war against drugs.
That's why it comes to this dramatic increase in <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to take people to <unk> people to rob a bicycle for small crimes versus property, rather than to make them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment doesn't do anything for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> Have you excited about it today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, <unk> might be in the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media means that the press means <unk> because our minds pay attention.
And that answers a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are getting a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And like nothing matters to survive, the first stop at all of those data is an old snippet of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector -- the <unk>
<unk> and recorded all of the information looking for something in the environment that I could harm harm.
So in a <unk> of the <unk> stories to look at the negative.
That old saying of the <unk> "If there is blood, <unk> is very true.
And given that all the digital devices give us negative news seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, 24 hours a day, is no wonder we are <unk>
It doesn't surprise you that people think the world is going on the worse.
But maybe not.
Maybe again, what happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps economic progress done in the last century for a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of wealth in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the extinction of species, <unk> water and <unk> no doubts we have it.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and the long time, we just just with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> the average income per capita per capita is <unk> across the world.
child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
Moreover, the cost of food food, of transportation and communications has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful age of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy spent 25 percent over 80 percent over the last 80 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people <unk>
And we keep <unk> more and bigger.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the United States, large part of the people who live under the poverty poverty have electricity, water, shelter, TV, cell conditioning and cars.
<unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the last century, <unk> on the planet would ever have dreamed of such <unk>
It's a lot of this technology -- and then the exponential growth of exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we took in technology technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law and double the price of the price at about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the mobile phone you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in the war and the peace, in recession in depression and <unk>
It's the result of fast computers used to build faster.
It doesn't stop any of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> in a law on the left, it curve up.
The growth rate of technology is in the faster and faster.
And in this curve, to the <unk> of Moore's Law is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computing in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computing and networks, and the <unk> 3D printing and their ability to democratize <unk> and <unk> the <unk> vaccines and the food, digital medicine, <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" for <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspapers the best headline that I would have.
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence on the cloud, available for all of the mobile phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the big challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to publish a company, or a product or a service that can be able to affect the whole lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> companies that have already been.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create life <unk> for each of the planet, it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that is <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with covered with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet -- it was worth more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of the South Washington is <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a <unk>
He's tied up by oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came up and made the aluminum something that we used as if it was <unk>
This analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy supplies.
And ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet <unk> for five times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about <unk> it's <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the fact of <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the United States parts of America, electricity will cost six cents a hour compared to 15 cents of national average.
And if we have sense of energy as we also have a lot of water.
Let's now talk about wars for water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the Voyager spaceship to the Earth, in 1990 after it was <unk>
And I took a famous picture, how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, water, 2 is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes to <unk> <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators of the <unk> I'd like to share with you, I gave me permission to <unk> her technology called <unk> <unk> already <unk> it's the size of a small refrigerator.
It's able to generate a thousand gallons of drinking water to the day of any source of <unk> water, water, water -- for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola has just thought that a major proof of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out, and I have full confidence that it would be, Coca-Cola will implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an extraordinary innovation for this technology that today.
And we've seen it on cell phones.
My God, we're going to get to the 70 percent reduction in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications in Kenya that the Wright president, 25 years ago.
And to tell you with a smart phone with Google, you have access to more knowledge and information that the president Clinton was 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of wealth of information and communications that no one might have ever been ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever been ever ever ever ever ever made.
And better than that, the things that you and I have paid for the things that you and I have paid for tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars and music -- technology <unk> technology -- <unk> <unk> and lose value value with cell phones.
Maybe the best thing to get up when the applications of health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which was called the X <unk> <unk> 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we have these technologies in a mobile device with which you speak, and given it <unk> you can get blood from the finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the payload of <unk> is 25 percent of the health care workers.
When this device would take a <unk> virus or DNA that we don't want to call to call the health care and, first of all, avoid that the pandemic happened.
But this is the largest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We have just spent the brand of 7 billion.
By the way, the best protection of demographic explosion is to provide the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it will go from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion of the minds have never been before <unk> to get to the global conversation.
What would you want these people?
What would <unk> What would <unk>
And rather than economic collapse will have the biggest economic injection of the story.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> more health, because of the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of impressions in 3D, and computing in the cloud will be more productive.
What can we give us three billion members of humanity, healthy <unk> and <unk>
So what about a few voices never before it was.
So what if we give the imagination wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and being able to act for the first one?
What would we find?
And if you're contributions that we can't <unk>
One thing that I learned with the X is that small equipment guided by their passion with a goal, they can do things -- things that before only could do big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that I really <unk>
There's a program that maybe some of you have heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids, and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this college teachers among others.
And then hundreds of thousands of people came around and started <unk>
And it has been shown that the machinery of human patterns is better folding proteins than the best computers.
And ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a huge trust in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of <unk> <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that we have to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we need to do.
We have for a few very extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You might think that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like this.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described to one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is on the Red Cross <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, on Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special of it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they keep <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: shift of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> to study a <unk> in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I was a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not out there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
<unk> was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from a few <unk>
There were <unk> from about 20 p.m. the <unk> <unk>
And the fishing fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so he became more than the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later the amount of fish had dropped in half.
I went to five inches.
You can get a genetic pressure.
There were no fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> at the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In <unk> 1970, he started in <unk> Europe, in a lot of development projects.
fishing development was imposing countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing fishing.
And this boat, quite <unk> was called <unk> 4.
I went out to fish in him, and we took studies in the south of the China Sea, <unk> and, above all, in the Sargasso Sea, and above all.
What we captured was something <unk>
<unk> now, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are blobs about a little bit of <unk> the remains of coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to cover and then it was <unk>
These images are remarkable because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you make a study and then start the commercial fishing fishing.
The background is going to be a solid coral fund, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
Once we captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to take it up, because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains what they collect fishermen every time they go to a area where they have never fish.
But it's not <unk>
<unk> the world but we don't remember it.
<unk> the starting point in the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time, it changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use the images in the beginning of their conscious life as the normal thing and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss of loss.
But they don't see the loss that happened before.
You can look at the concept of change.
And at the end, I keep a few <unk> remains.
And that, in great measure, it's what we want to do now.
We want to keep things that are no longer that they are.
But you should think that this problem affects people when the European societies kill animals without knowing what they have done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> is a little <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this doesn't perceive as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on large animals, and in an synonymous of large fish.
They become little frequent because the <unk>
And then we have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why did we accept this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, which was very different.
And they will do it because evidence presented in a way of the way that they would expect to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> as a captain of it, and so I watched a lot of fish in this area that can't be used or generally don't use the <unk> scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
Out of the huge role that can make a protected marine area.
Because with marine marine areas, we actually <unk> the past.
<unk> the past people can't think about it, because the point of starting has been running and it's very low.
That's for people that you can see a protected marine area and you can benefit from the vision that you can tell, which allows you to delete your point.
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the West, for example?
I think there are arts and cinema maybe can fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a <unk> simulation of <unk>
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay, 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people go through the movie -- I will talk about the story of <unk> why would we react to <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only thing to giving, is Cameron, to do <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and I look at YouTube YouTube video.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why the videos are made of it, and what importance has to do that.
We all want to be <unk> -- <unk> <unk> <unk> when I was younger, that seemed very, very hard.
But today the web video makes any of us or our actions, copper corresponds to a part of our global culture.
Any one can be done on the Internet in a <unk>
It goes over 48 hours to YouTube for a minute.
And of course, only a small percentage becomes viral makes a myriad of <unk> and it makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things out of trends, communities of participation and <unk>
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
My God.
Wow!
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot out of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the views in the popularity of the popularity of the popularity of the last summer.
<unk> didn't deserve to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if you're called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were already published many videos of nature.
This video had posted in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this feeling that I would go to the video to the <unk>
The trends of trends like Jimmy <unk> are present and interesting things and <unk> to a wider audience.
RS: <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start on the weekend   You all want to get the weekend       <unk> Friday. <unk> the Friday.  KA: Don't think that we can have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> from RS: Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows how often we use.
Like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come out of nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday <unk>
Well, he took <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science -- was one of the first people in making a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a <unk> group of trends take a point of view and share it with a wider public accelerating the process.
So this community of people who shares this big internal joke then starts talking about that and doing stuff.
And now there are 10,000 pounds of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for every one of the other days.
Unlike the <unk> <unk> of the 20th century, this community engagement is our way to be part of the phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation <unk> with a <unk> music.
That's it. That's it.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that it's rare, you know that there is a version of three hours that have been seen four million times.
You saw this video.
And there are cats that you saw other cats to see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up between the <unk> community.
There were <unk>
Someone made a version of the ancient one.
And then it became the rule.
Suddenly, the whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a silly joke to something that we all can form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who might have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> <unk> or RS: Black or <unk> <unk>
What script might have been written on this situation?
In a world where you go up two days per minute, just the only only thing and unexpected can be <unk> in the way that these things have been.
When a friend told me that I had to see this big video of a kind that protest against <unk> <unk> in New York City, I admit that I didn't get too much too much.
Casey <unk> I'm going to be <unk> because of the <unk> but often there are obstacles that keep you circular for the <unk>
KA: Thank you to the surprise of surprise and your humor, Casey <unk> I got to get five and understand her idea.
So this approach is worth for all the new thing we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of <unk> creative communities of participation, totally unexpected, are characteristics of a new type of media -- in which we all have access and is the audience that defines the majority.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin Bieber started on YouTube.
Don't stop permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners from our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- they're just the current media of the current media -- but we have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit of unit and freedom from their country.
<unk> as the <unk> go in <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so long, friends, now I <unk>
It's <unk> in silence.
He died broken for the story.
He's my grandfather.
I met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget her story.
My job was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but they <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> to the sea.
My mother, <unk> I was just 18 when her father died, and marriage marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined to a <unk> <unk> the escape from their family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I could do it.
And after a <unk> of four years to challenge the fiction, a boat goes down to the sea of the ship <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear were the Iranians and the death.
Like most adults, my mother had a <unk> with poison.
If we were <unk> first we had my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the engine -- the <unk> diving into every wave, and the vast and empty horizon, <unk>
I don't remember hackers who came up several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men in our boat, or the engine dying and unable to start for six hours.
But I remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, I end up the journey was too much to it; and the first apple that I asked given for the men in the platform.
No one apple had after the same flavor.
And after three months in a refugee camp, we would go in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations give a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> suburb whose population is comprised of immigrants from immigration.
Unlike the middle suburbs in the middle class, whose existence would be <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The odor that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English was <unk> between people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a line of <unk> cars, working six days, double turn.
And yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT <unk> of the <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and the time an extra sweater, in English and mathematics, it wouldn't mind what it should be <unk> that was usually <unk> it was always <unk>
Two hundred pairs to school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> go home."
So at home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating and determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I would go in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we would take us on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother suffered <unk> all the boat.
And my task was to be wakes up until their nightmares can begin to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women came out with their stories about men who couldn't make the <unk> angry and <unk> boys and children who were trapped in between two worlds.
They looked and <unk>
And they were created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the ultimate classic student <unk> with what I was talking about myself.
In the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives of <unk> by violence, abuse and isolation.
But many of them got help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer -- I picked the young U.S.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the another, but the edges were not <unk>
So <unk> penguin <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and social activist -- invited me to talk in sites that I had never heard -- and in houses whose existence she'd never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat to the <unk> and the comfort of life on a suburb -- <unk> -- a mother and two daughters end the day as they did for nearly 20 years, <unk> on the day of every single day and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I was now the same age that she had when we go into the boat.
The "no" ever had ever been a choice.
He said, "What is you not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the most frankly speak, more I was <unk> to talk.
I met people from all the roads in life, a lot of them doing what we were living on the border of possible.
And although I finished my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a race race.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a unknown, a <unk> new on the scene -- and not only it's fine, but it's something that being grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps out of my happy place to know that, yes, that the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that they hadn't been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, an optimism mixture of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> a small group of people who <unk> can't <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For one year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant <unk> <unk>
<unk> until well at the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some bright and we opened up.
I took the decision to move to the United States.
And after a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, there were <unk> and <unk>
Before I end up, let me tell you about my grandmother's grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who was worried about.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
The 17 became <unk> from a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without support of her husband, he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't demonstrated it to be wrong.
I was in the shower at the fourth of a hotel <unk> when she died, a thousand miles, in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I watched it stand on the other side.
I knew he had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around the <unk>
We tell them and make sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came up and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
Don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Because of those who we were and how our life created we can now see that men who would have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have <unk> easily.
Now I want to have my own children, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could wish that for you?
But I'm afraid the privilege of the easy right of the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave in every wave, the constant pace of the engine -- the vast horizon, that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it up and look at a safe to do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is today in the fourth or <unk>
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert -- under the sky <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation of how nothing changed from the age of ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time, when I <unk> the great warrior German prince prince was <unk> I would pull up a arch and with a <unk> to the ground, <unk> water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced with the magic.
And that struck me a lot.
Every time I felt a little bit more about <unk>
I would tell you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera -- if I couldn't touch my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic <unk>
My grandfather gave me her <unk> <unk>
And this piece of technological piece was to my most magical thing.
It became a golden door, to a world full of imagery, and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phone, the luxury bone and cameras prevent them to <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I came up with this technological world to see what we would use to create magic instead of <unk>
<unk> books from 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a <unk> device able to connect the readers in the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where do we are.
Put the text with the image, animation and feel.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But why is that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive application for iPad.
It says, <unk> your toes on every light."
And so --  He says, "This box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In several times I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live because of GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl are excited with all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and dragons to that magic of the childhood, to those ideas that <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned me very exciting.
So over here, we have to expand the iPad to release the fireflies.
And really, they light your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy to a <unk>
So here, every book and every single world transforms into a <unk> that I drag towards this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In the entire book, I have always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that it picks up, <unk> and guide you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book is also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important aspect for me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people out of India know their <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras before before the millennia, in an old <unk> book.
So we're bringing back into a child history.
In a story that deals with current issues like environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> have not gone out to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can get our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the <unk> <unk> is this adventure where you have to go out in the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images from different natural objects.
As a girl had a lot of <unk> <unk> rocks, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So in order to restore this childhood ritual -- you have to go out and in a chapter -- you know, a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter you have to take a picture of a piece of scale, and then <unk>
This is a digital collection of photos that then can put on the Web.
An London boy puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A boy from India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Inside the connection of connection, the Earth and technology is a lot of possibilities.
In the next book we need to have a interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and using augmented reality -- it sees a group of encouraged <unk> that appear on the sea plants of the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves up.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
So we're going to a world where the forces of nature is <unk> with technology and magic and technology gets closer to one another.
<unk> the power of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic joy and child love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to tell you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a director of listening.
And not a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or asked patients, family and <unk> What would you say?
How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems that all, or perhaps not everybody, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail, because we stopped listening.
This is my Wi-Fi
It has a <unk> and <unk>
All the morning I would tell me.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to get 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what's my problem of weight, not at the same time in which I need assistance assistance or some urgency of that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like a few of you know, I have more than <unk> Twitter on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I go back to my car, people start <unk> <unk> today I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for the patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move the people from their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
So from the week next to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people would take them from their houses, taking their blood pressure to their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they become <unk> and to be captains of their own <unk> but we also can help us care of health care because of the challenges we face, as the firing of the attention of <unk> attention, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share with you with a video.
We all have <unk> <unk>
Maybe we even have on our cell phones.
We know perfectly where the machines are in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find networks of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saving lives right now.
What we did was do it <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes it opens up in <unk> <unk>
And more than 10,000 <unk> were already presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we did an application for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next few to use your cell cell phone, to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I want to present this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we would <unk> globally.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so that we help us find and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> worldwide.
Every time you go on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us memorize these <unk>
They might be a <unk> or people of <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> which is still in its place.
Please compare it in this and not just improving health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take their cameras.
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed up with my previous passion for the drawing, but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera to the process was in planning.
And when you take a picture with a camera -- the process ends up when the <unk>
And to me the photograph I had more than to see with being in the right place at the right time.
I thought anyone could do it.
So I wanted to create something different -- a process that would start by press the <unk>
<unk> like this is a building in a very small road in a <unk>
But it has an unexpected turn.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or photos like <unk> dark and colorful things -- but with the common goal to keep the <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can <unk> but I always want it to be captured in some way like photograph.
And I think that you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capture an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it real.
It's the details or the <unk>
Let's make light?
What is he creating <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk>
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is <unk>
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a way, you can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if you existed.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's go to the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that doesn't really make meaning.
And I see the same process to combine the pictures.
It's really to combine different realities.
And the things that make a picture as realistic I think they're those in which we don't even understand the things that are surrounding us in our everyday lives.
But when I combine photographs is very important, because otherwise something else is going to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will go to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the <unk> photos must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet with these <unk> were taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of the different images with a perfect child.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think this is the picture of a landscape and the bottom part is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of photographs of different places.
And I think it's easier to create a place that you find out because you don't need to wear the ideas that have in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in the winter knew that I had several months to <unk> to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured in a fishing journey.
The shores are from a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a <unk>
And yes, I even made red home at the top of the island so that it looks more <unk>
So to make a realistic outcome. I think it takes to planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you make a good job when you take the pictures -- the result can be very beautiful, and it can be very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anyone who took from a "Creative <unk>
I'm not interested in showing you the details, but the general way.
This is about a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this, as many other we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk>
In other words, every step from here represents an order of magnitude on the scale.
I'm going to talk about technology with curves -- it's new stuff.
Here's something strange.
And so I'm going to talk to you.
Please turn the lights.
<unk> more intensity because I write about paper.
Why would we make technology curves.
The answer is that if I draw it into a normal curve where I say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of technology that I wanted to <unk> the diagram would look something ridiculous.
That would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you ask for example, some other technology, like transportation in a <unk> curve would be very silly, we would see a straight line.
But if it's something like this, it's a <unk> change.
If the technology of transport would be as fast as the last <unk> we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There is an unprecedented story in the history of technological growth, which every few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- we look at these <unk> curves. We see that we don't keep forever.
It's not possible to support this change as fast as it is.
So let's take one of two things.
Or it's okay to become a typical curve -- I know like this until it comes up something totally different -- or maybe it will do something like this.
That's what it can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're at a transition from what it used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I try to ask is, and ask myself, what is that new way we take the world <unk>
Why new state is running the world?
The transition is very, very terrifying if we are engaged in it.
I remember the future of the future happened in 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future is <unk> year after year, along my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
So a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a much sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it all will be so different than extrapolate -- what we're doing today is no meaning.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition that <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand is taking a distance and look at the long term.
The time scale, where I would like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So we go back about two billion years when the Earth was a huge <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals coming around it.
If we look at the way that those chemists give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that moment, I had floating some oil <unk> with all sorts of chemical prescriptions in their inside.
Some of those blobs of oil contain a particular combination of chemicals that were made to incorporate the materials out of the outside and so the drops grew in grew a particular combination of chemicals.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most unhealthy forms of oil <unk>
But those blobs were not alive in the current sense, because every one of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time you get <unk> a distribution <unk> distribution of chemists that <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow gets <unk> being better at the time to incorporate chemical <unk> more <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more.
They usually live more <unk>
It was a form of life, small, very simple, but things became interesting when these <unk> learned the <unk> trick.
In some way that we don't understand very well these <unk> learned to store information.
They learned to save data, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, we go into this no sense, a language system that allowed them to record what they were to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same language system.
In fact, every living thing is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did only for <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have a 100 percent of white dust that I try to hide the security security people.
But <unk> I took this <unk> code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and is here.
If it was a <unk> he would have put it on a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy, another billion years.
But then the other interesting step in which things would be very different in which things were going to be very different -- and it was that these cells started sharing and communicate information into the cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can change DNA.
So for example, we evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin, and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are a lot of resilient to penicillin, because bacteria communicate.
This communication has place to be able to get communities that in a way, they were together in it, and a <unk>
From that <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community would be <unk> and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the turning point happened when these communities came back so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe in the community in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have <unk> communities of many different types working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is not the heart of the heart, or the <unk> or the brain, etc.
So these communities evolved and made more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they don't do more than process information in community.
It's the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community to be the responsible structures to understand and convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as a <unk> learning was confined to the length of an organism, and not to the time period of evolutionary time.
So one organism could, for example, learning not to eat any <unk> because he knew the wrong and got sick at the last time.
That could happen during the life of a organism given that before these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years for death of individuals who ate that fruit on that own.
So the fact that the nervous system built those structures of information has seen enormously the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an amazing invention.
I have a very complicated idea, an idea of <unk> in your head.
I'm sitting here emitting a few <unk> and, hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> <unk> in their heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated we convert it in sound, in sound, and produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing <unk>
Now we go through periods similar to <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods and processing information.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
<unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and so forth, are the specialized devices that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than what we do before.
Now evolution can happen in moments.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the program <unk> to our eyes.
And now we've sped up the scales again.
The first stages of the story that I told you took a billion years every one.
The next few days, the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
<unk> the language and so on, took less than a million years.
And the branches as the electronics, it seems to take only a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess that <unk> is the right word to name something that makes your own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see that the process is <unk>
But I make a career designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent developments in the present.
But now design objects from such complexity that would be impossible to me in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor on that machine from connections.
There are thousands of millions.
Instead, with <unk> designers -- we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that does something that before I didn't do, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using here, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that works on the scale of the zoo.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions from instructions to <unk>
You could run these random instructions at random, running all of those programs -- and take those ones that more <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to make an numbers, to put a simple example.
So we find the programs that most people come up to the face of numbers.
Sure, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one luckily, I could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the <unk>
And we get those and <unk> those and <unk>
And now we need to make the ones better <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to a process of <unk> Mars <unk>
Let's take two programs that are <unk> children, who are <unk> <unk> and the children will have the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs of programs that had a little bit more of success.
And we say, "Please repeat over the <unk>
Let me come back again.
We would have some mutations <unk>
And it tries to try and connect with another generation.
Well, every generation carries a few milliseconds.
So I can make the equivalent of millions of evolution in a few minutes or in a few hours, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that orders numbers in a perfect way.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell how they work.
I've tried to combine them to see how they work.
They're black programs, strangers.
But they meet <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a bloodline a hundred thousand programs that they did it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on this.
One time I was on a <unk> with <unk> <unk> and she picks up a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer an flight.
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to rely on computers to make design very different design.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering does.
However, we don't understand all the choices that there is.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so being able to run these programs much faster.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at a kind of analogous moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We're <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of creating what is coming to come.
But now it comes the lunch, and I think I will stop here before I <unk>
I think we need to do something with a part of medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give you part of my fake design on that.
Before I treat the topic of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We are about the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about getting <unk> <unk> talks about statistics and use it to form a big baseball equipment.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you have heard of it.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we talk about 300 of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means that the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball to the field of play without being <unk> and that any one who is about <unk> to the first base of the bottom, not to get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three attempts to 10.
You know how they call a <unk> of 300 in <unk>
Well, you know, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, that is somebody who is 10 <unk> it hit four.
<unk> like Ted Ted Williams, the last player player of the League <unk> of <unk> in running more 400 <unk> in a regular season.
Now I would take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're sustaining to a surgeon that has also a record of 400 in <unk>
This doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place and a being wanted to have two <unk> <unk> and his family doctor goes to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But you know what?
She is getting better improving this year.
They have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you.
What do you believe that you should be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon or a <unk> or a <unk>
<unk> very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, from a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is the people in the world, and I would stand up with the viewer of being perfect.
And that ever, I'd ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it good.
That was the message that I was going on, when I was in medical school.
I was an obsessional student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school, said Brian Goldman studied up to a blood test.
Like that.
<unk> in my small <unk> in the Japanese Hospital in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
In my class of the anatomy, <unk> the origin of every heartbeat that comes out of the <unk> -- the frequent <unk> diagnostic diagnosis and <unk>
And I even knew visual diagnosis about how we classify <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from medical school with the impression that if you were looking at everything, then you would know everything, or as possible, you would close to the everything, because I would tell me of the errors.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when brought to the lady in the emergency service where I was working on.
At that time, I was given to the service service.
And I applied to a cardiologist to go to a cardiologist to go to that patient.
And to report <unk>
When I watched the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which gave me a heart heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart leaves to work and, rather than pump blood forward, blood goes to the lungs, these are <unk> and so there is a difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I would take it.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in his heart.
I gave him a drink of water, so I could eliminate liquid <unk>
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I sat very well.
And there was when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes actually.
He sent her home without talking to the <unk>
I didn't put the phone or I didn't do what I should have done that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, there would be able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident who would have constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even touching my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
And I would send it to her home, I didn't take attention to a voice on my inside that I would say, <unk> is not a good idea. It's not a good idea.
In fact, I was so safe that I asked the nurse to go to the <unk> <unk> "Do you think it's okay if you're going to your <unk>
And the nurse thought and she said to complete <unk> "Yes, I think I'm good."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up and signed up and the ambulance alongside the parents took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach,
But I kept my job.
At the end of the day, I was going to leave the hospital and walked into the parking parking parking lot where my car to go home. At that time I did something that I don't do normally,
It happened for the emergency service service to home.
And there was another nurse, not the one that I was talking about the <unk> lady before, but another one told me three words, those three words that most of the emergency medical doctors <unk>
Other specialists fear them as well, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and is that we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: Does it happen?
He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with complete <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the verge of death.
At the time of an hour to have come to her house, after I gave him the high, he suffered a collapse and her family called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> of 50 millimeters <unk> which means a shock shock to it.
I just breathe and I was blue.
The emergency personnel <unk> all their resources.
They gave him medication to go up with blood pressure.
And they put a <unk> artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> up to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because after the <unk> were in intensive therapy and I was expected for all of the hope to be <unk>
And in the two or three days, it was obvious that I never had it.
I had a <unk> cerebral damage.
The family got involved.
And at eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was going on.
And in the ninth day, he left him to go. Mrs. mother and grandmother.
They say they never get the names of the people who die.
That was my first experience.
And the weeks later, I would tell you about it and I experienced that for the first time the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I sat up by just, isolated without feeling that healthy shame because you can't deal with your peers.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> <unk> that I talk about is that it makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the thing that tells us not that what we did was evil, but we are bad.
And that meant that.
And it wasn't by my <unk> he was a <unk>
I spoke to the family and I'm sure I would take the stuff and I made sure that I didn't get <unk>
And I kept <unk> those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did I send her home to his home.
And in my worst <unk> why made a mistake that <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Soon the feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And in a day <unk> opened the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if you were looking at the efforts to be perfect for not to make more mistakes, I would do the <unk>
And it was.
I went back to work.
But it turned to happen.
Two years later, it was <unk> in the emergency community in a community hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got to a <unk> man.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he would fly here.
I watched her because I was a little <unk>
<unk> penicillin, and sent him to his home.
But while he led to the door, I kept pointing out her <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my <unk> change, my boss asked me to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I took three words: Does it remember this?
Remember the patient who saw for a pain in <unk>
So he came back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
I had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but the upper airline can be causing the close of those questions.
He luckily, he wasn't dead.
You would give antibiotics antibiotics on it, and you hit the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> we don't <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially to work in a hospital, because it would be 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> <unk>
<unk> an X-ray of kidneys, but it turns out normal -- a colleague who was checking into the patient -- a certain sensitivity in the bottom right and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read a liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague who would do it.
I check it up and see a certain sensitivity on the lower bottom right, he called the surgeon.
Both were operated and they recovered well as well.
But every case, I would tell you about me?
But I'd like to tell you I made the worst errors in the first five years of exercise and like a lot of colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most meaningful have been over the last five years.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't tell you and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how I can share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this to not make the same <unk>
If I would go back to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course in a party you'll hear about the errors of other doctors, but you won't hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg is that I would have a chance to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> those who make errors and the ones that don't have to sleep and the ones that don't can sleep and the ones who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that begin to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you take care of medicine to people who make mistakes, we will stay a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years, about diffusion and medical journalism -- I've done a personal study of bad medical litigation and medical errors to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote for the Cuban Toronto, to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that errors are <unk>
We work in a system where errors happen every day, where one of every 10 drugs <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where <unk> infections are more and more <unk> eliciting chaos and death.
In this country, they die <unk> <unk> by Palestinian <unk>
The United States Institute in the United States established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A <unk> system where the knowledge goes down every two or three years, and we don't have <unk>
sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow to make a perfect history of a patient with pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in your chest, it comes up with <unk> eyes, and with breath alcohol and, suddenly, my story <unk> from contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They don't pollute their symptoms as long as the same way.
All the errors are inevitable.
So if you take the system like we <unk> and we eliminate all the professional professionals -- well, not to stay anybody.
And with respect to people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white art, it's already a habit saying, "That is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the <unk> to the <unk> of surgery -- "That is my worst <unk> blah blah -- <unk> "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone towards them.
And their students would be <unk> <unk> the head and <unk> saliva and start counting their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You could say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> doctor is human, and the human doctor is human, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn about what happened to teach others.
They take their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their errors.
<unk> the errors of other people not with the intention of <unk> but a sense of loving and support for everybody to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes humans to run the system, and when that happens, they make errors in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I'm human <unk> errors <unk>
And I feel a lot of hard and effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words, I remember it.
Do you know how many choices we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
Recently, I made a survey for more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to choose an American American.
Not a lot, in a research followed for a group of a group of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks for these executives and the time that we would take to make decisions about those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> jobs for week.
Naturally, every work included a lot of <unk>
Half of those choices took nine minutes or less.
Only 20 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about their choices.
Do you know how many belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do you evaluate the way that you deal with those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> to pick up the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When I do a question, as I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Again, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, are ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
I was a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this high level of level of level -- at least in that time was very sophisticated.
He was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were about 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> more than 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and <unk> and 25 percent of water, and this was when we were taking water from the <unk>
I loved going to that shop, but I asked myself to ask me, why I never bought nothing?
This is the <unk> <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones who were in <unk> <unk>
I once I decided to go to the manager and I asked him, "I'm okay with this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out to me the buses full of tourists that were all the day, usually with their cameras.
So we decided to do a small experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had <unk> different classes.
And I put a put for <unk> just to the input of the shop.
We put it out of six <unk> or 15 different flavors and we looked at two things: First, where people were willing to stop stopping <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> a 60 that when there were only six percent.
We also look at what if they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
When I stopped when there were <unk> only three percent came to buy <unk>
When I stood when there were six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people have six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were still six.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> we probably <unk> less is good to conserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> of choices is affecting us very <unk>
We decided not to decide, even when this didn't be <unk>
Now the topic of the day, saving financial savings
I'm going to tell you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at the chances of savings savings for the age of about a million Americans, from a number of 650 plans from this country.
We were interested in looking at if the number of <unk> research available for pension savings plans.
And we found that I actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans to go from two, to 59 choices.
We found that the biggest age number was <unk> there were less participation.
So if you look at the ends, we see that in the plans that they offer twice the rate of participation -- or more, not as high as I want.
And in the plans that offer about 60 percent, the death rate came to the <unk> 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choice, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for the ones that they decided to participate, as much as the number of choice, more people would be able to avoid actions or investment funds.
As much more choice, they were more willing to invest in financial financial failures.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are <unk> to optimize financial financial well-being.
In the earlier years, we've seen three negative implications to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we need the decision that <unk> even when it goes against the self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst choices in finance, and in health.
They are more likely to choose things less <unk> even though we see it better.
The main reason is that we <unk> with looking at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for <unk> and to choose that amazing <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in a shape or another, in different research, so they can test them in their business.
The first one is, <unk>
You've heard before, but it's never been more true than today, which less is more.
People are always disturbed when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you decide to cut, we get rid of strange <unk> options, there will be an increase in sales <unk> the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When you go to & <unk> it went out of 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, you saw 10 percent of 10 at sales.
When the <unk> Golden <unk> took the products out of cats -- which less <unk> has increased the <unk> in <unk> for two <unk> and low cost costs.
You know that the stop today in average, you have 45 products.
In a grocery store, they offer about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the current world is <unk> and it provides only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce?
In the world of financial rights, I think one of the best examples that have come out of how to handle better choices is David <unk> the Harvard show.
Every Harvard at Harvard are <unk> automatically to a foreign background of life.
The people who truly want to choose, they offer 20 or more.
You know that often people say, "I don't know how <unk>
They're all <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there are between those choices.
And if your employees can't afford it, you can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before this session, I was speaking to <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people in this audience about a holiday with all the way to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave you about a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a hand if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> Okay. Anyone who's ready to take the supply.
They're not else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that <unk>
I think I really went to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first trial, which in the second <unk> but I can tell you that you thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the <unk> of choice which is <unk>
For people understand the differences between choice, they have to understand the consequences of every option, and the consequences must feel very much very concrete in a very concrete way.
Why is people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average, when it uses debit cards or credit that when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get them to do more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> who were working in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
That meeting, that <unk> exactly how they <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that I would give you the staff that you would think about the positive things that you would find in your lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was a increase in the <unk> of 20 and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than choices.
For example, this is a study we did in a aisle of magazines.
We found out that in the <unk> <unk> along the <unk> <unk> the magazines of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how we <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other one.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few of those.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's correct.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This <unk> scheme is totally useful.
The categories have to indicate something about the <unk> not what the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of fundraising.
I'm supposed to who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle much more information than what we think about if you just get a little bit.
We have to augment the gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision that buys a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allows it to <unk>
You've got to take 60 decisions, to put your car.
And these choices vary in the number of choices that are offering each other.
<unk> color outside the car, I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is we can vary the order of the order of decisions.
So the middle of the clients are going to go from a lot of choice, 56 colors, to a few four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go in a few choice, four <unk> to 56 colors, a lot of choices.
And what am I going to say?
What do you do?
If you look at the <unk> button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that those who go from a lot of choices to <unk> the button for defect again and again, and another more.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they continue there.
The same data, the same number of choices.
The only thing that I did was alter the order in which information is presented with information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Though we choose the box of changes doesn't say anything about the preferences of <unk> <unk> in all ways to make us a choice.
We're excited about a product that we're building now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alternatives -- we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've presented to you were designed to help manage <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their business, or for people who work.
It's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is being careful to the <unk>
And the more careful we will be in our best choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1920s, in the East East Germany, if you had a machine to write it should be <unk> in front of the government.
And I had to record a sheet of example written with the machine.
And this for the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a written written with the wrong message, they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West, we don't imagine that somebody could do this, how much that we would make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer in any big maker of any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having a few yellow printed yellow points on every page that you can own one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And no one looks like a lot of this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the Web.
If we see what happens in the world online, we can put up the attacks according to their <unk>
There are three main groups there.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
The mobile phone phone is very easy to understand.
These guys earn money.
They use the cyberattacks to earn a lot of money, a lot of numbers.
There are really many of a lot of <unk> online, <unk> that we have money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal media using <unk> bank to rob any money from our guarantee when we buy <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy on a <unk> computer.
The secret service of the U.S., two months ago, we would have the bank account.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know her <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us is a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be bad.
In the future, most of the <unk> crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not inspired by the money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate them the protests, they motivate them to motivate them to motivate them.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a genuine role in the attacks online.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it for protest and the last group are the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of a government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands, or, actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall in the last fall because of a <unk>
You have the security of the site and a <unk>
Last week I asked him in a meeting with representatives of the Dutch government asked to one of the leaders if they <unk> <unk> death of people to cause the attack to <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how people die from a attack of these?
<unk> is an authority <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What is the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services -- <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we would take a foreign authority.
And the fact that <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring, and those things that have happened for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters based based on April 2011 and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Amongst those papers was this folder, called <unk>
And within that folder, there were notes of a company based in Germany that had been sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept a huge scale of the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right there.
I mean, Western governments provide tools to governments to do this to their citizens.
But the Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, a couple of weeks ago, he found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to research their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a safe case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today is more there.
You get the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the arguments online, to get our data.
When we think about a lot of things like these obvious answer should be "Well, it sounds bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm a honest.
Why do you <unk>
I don't have anything to do it.
And that argument doesn't make meaning.
It's in play.
The privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that we would spend today, will be forever.
<unk> <unk> in any future government, in a administration.
These are the questions you have to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the South Park National Park.
These are cows from my father at the bottom, and behind the cows the National Park.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences at most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate to the park.
They attract predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones who killed at night, and as soon as we got in the morning and we found it dead in the morning and found it dead because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value it.
So I grew up a lot of <unk>
<unk> are warriors that protect our community and the livestock, and also <unk> with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years, is responsible for the livestock of her father and this was the same thing that I thought about me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions was fear.
But I realized that actually we didn't think about it, because I actually helped the lions look at the pen away.
I didn't tell me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to trick the lions so they were near the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and the second day, and the second day, and they came up and said, this thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So I jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come back.
I found that lions are afraid to the light that is moving.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch that I would turn up and turn the lights.
And this is a little lamp from a <unk> <unk>
It's <unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the small box -- I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, they go out -- because that's where lions.
And that's what lions see when they come at night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago and since then, we never had trouble with lions.
And the houses in the neighborhood you heard the idea.
One of them is about this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by all Kenya, to freak out other predators like <unk> <unk> and also is using <unk> elephants as well.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate to get a scholarship in one of the best schools, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited about.
My new school now is helping to raise money and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and set up lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a child in meadows of the <unk> <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see airplane flying planes and told me that one day would be inside of you.
And here I am today.
I got a chance to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer an engineer and a pilot when I grow.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows from my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to listen to a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yeah.
CA: You're working on other electrical strategy.
What's the next thing in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do one close to CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know that you have been invented using electric fences but I want to do my own.
CA: So you know, this is a time, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried before, but I have tried before, but I got a <unk>  CA: At foot, Richard <unk> are a big thing.
We're going to take it up in every step that I would spend friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> anything."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we spent all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Though I asked myself about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until all of a <unk>
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public work.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my colleague of my sister.
And he said, "When we did this, the five family members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks.
We are <unk> together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're prepared to die."
I was very upset.
It was the first time that I heard people were suffering in my country.
At a little time, when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't delete my memory.
A woman with no life was killed in the street, holding a child <unk> in her arms by looking at her face of her mother without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A massive famine would <unk> North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North America died during hunger, and only a few survived eating grass, insects and tree.
They also became more and more importantly, the energy <unk> all around it was completely dark in the night except for the lights in China, barely crossing the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the countries in the world.
This is the <unk> river that serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North America across <unk>
But many of them died.
Sometimes, they see bodies floating on the river, in the river, of time.
I can't disclose the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that for the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I would be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no sense of how life would be like refugee <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but dangerous, because the North America in China were illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear of my identity to be <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destiny in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested by the Chinese police and I was <unk> at the police season.
Someone had been accused by being <unk> then I would take my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was <unk>
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to wrap up.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a official told her to another, "This was a fake report.
And he left me to go. It was a miracle.
Some North America are looking for asylum <unk>
But many of you can be arrested for the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Though there were <unk> were eventually released after a price of international <unk>
These North America didn't have as much luck.
Every year, countless North America are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they are <unk> and <unk>
Though I was lucky to escape many other North America have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North America have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language, and to find work all the world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years to hide my identity, I've decided to be going to South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
And also, I understood that there was a great gap between North and South Africa.
We're all <unk> but in the inside, we've come to be very different from <unk> years of <unk>
It even went through an identity.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call a sense of mine.
Though I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. I started to study for the drive of income to college.
Just when I started <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korea authorities took some money to my family and, as <unk> my family was going to be displaced to the force to a remote location in the <unk>
They had to get it out.
I started planning to help them escape.
The North America have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to take it in a way, for more than 3,000 miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost trapped various times.
Once, our bus was stopped and addressed by a official police officer.
He asked them to identification around and started asking questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official came up to my family, I would go back, and I told him who were people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed it.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the <unk> C.O.s in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated to cross the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the smallest points in my life.
I did all to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison to the short distance from the South Korea.
I would go and came up with the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man asked, "What is the problem?"
I was so impressed that a stranger would care to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary I explained the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other North America and take them out of prison.
I took him up with all my heart, and I said, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown unknown, a new hope for me and for the village <unk> when I more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the legacy of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But getting their freedom is only half of the battle.
Many North America are separated from their families and when we take a new country, they start with little or nothing of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language, practices and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue in contact with family still inside, and we send information and money that are helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North America a chance to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North America across the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South surgery.
This is <unk> <unk> stores, fast food, <unk>
So the city towns in the city came together and they thought, we're going to change the National Center name for it to represent something else, so they changed the Los Angeles -- as if that <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Africa --  <unk> <unk> fast food, <unk>
Like <unk> millions of other Americans, I live in a food desert -- Los Angeles Center to the home of the food places to take and eat in the car.
What's interesting is that the places of food to carry kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of waterborne diseases in the Los Angeles Center in the South Pole.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times more than say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
So I would tell you that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and then every time you go out of the <unk> effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see <unk> wheels and sold as <unk>
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this should stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I already got tired of running 45 minutes back, and back to buy an apple that doesn't have <unk>
What I did, was to plant a food forest in front of my house.
In one of the land that we call a <unk>
It's about 45 meters x three me.
The point is, that belongs to the city.
But you have to understand it.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me on win because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This was how I decided to understand it.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we get together and we started to plant our food forest -- trees -- you know, nine fresh vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of set of group as long as made by gardeners of all the <unk> of all the city and completely volunteer, and all we do is for free.
And the backyard, was beautiful.
Then someone got <unk>
The city stood up on top and a summary I got a <unk> saying that I had to remove my backyard, the <unk> was made <unk>
And I said, "Come on, really?
An order of court to plant food in a piece of land that no one <unk>  So I was like, "Well, I <unk>
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
L.A. -- he had the story written by Steve <unk> and I spoke to the <unk> and one of the Green <unk> members who put a request in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
It's about 68 miles of <unk>
That's about 20 Central dollars.
That's a room enough to plant <unk> billion plants.
Why does the hell look like this?
You know, a plant will give a few thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of fact.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, they cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Africa.
I grew up there. It was my children there.
So I was going to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I cultivate my art.
Just like an artist's artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the backyard, the ground, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
It's <unk> to see what the earth can do, if you stop your canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing this is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became a tool of education, of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We're the land.
It's <unk> to see how it affects kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Besides, you get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and were in my backyard, I went out and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad things were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame by looking at people who were so close to me with hungry, and this is just turning the why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people will rob your <unk>
So I say, "For God no, I am not afraid to go to <unk>
That's in the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to buy it, but at your time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion, which I put a garden in a shelter in the middle of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how that had caught and how they used to plant their mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how the changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had, as about 50 people who come, they work and <unk> all in voluntary.
If kids cultivate <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If you cultivate <unk> they'll eat <unk>  But if any of you are going to be <unk> if you don't teach them how food affects the mind and the body, eat blind what you put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which you're standing there, I see kids of color that are in this path designed for them, which doesn't take it nowhere.
So with the <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington, <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the Earth, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my plan. This is something I want to do.
I want to plant all a block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take <unk> and convert it into <unk>
I didn't tell me?
I'm not talking about free, because it's free it's not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability is you have to <unk>
So what I'm talking about is to try to work with people in the street to get the kids out of the street, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets of farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to do sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> gardeners gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That <unk> take their <unk> OK?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet me, well, if you want to see me, I don't call me if you want to sit on comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a little road at all.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that you know.
And especially if you go on a bicycle on your bicycle and these automobiles go, that's not very nice.
In addition, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, you would want a quiet road on the world.
The solution for that is to do roads in asphalt <unk>
<unk> <unk> a material that we use now in most roads in the Netherlands, of the Netherlands, and the water can move through it, so all the water of rain flow over the sides and you have a road because it's easy to drive, and not <unk> water never else.
The noise also disappear.
Because it's very young, all the <unk> -- so it's a very quiet road in it.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see, you see that in this road the rocks goes out.
First of a stone, then several more and more and more and more and more and so on, and I will say, well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can see the damage in this material.
It's a <unk> asphalt as I said, so there's only a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> -- the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they <unk> they're going to be <unk> and <unk> from the <unk>
So if you drive on the road, you get the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we will probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> <unk> of that to clean up, and we can cut the iron wool into a very small chunks, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with small bits of iron <unk>
And then you need a machine, like what you see here, that you use a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat up, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat the steel, melt out the <unk> the <unk> flow of these <unk> and the stones go back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great machine from <unk> here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the show that it comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
We tested a lot of samples there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So you gave us a piece of road track, 400 meters of the <unk> <unk> where we had to make a lane lane to try this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then of course, this road last several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the laboratory.
We asked the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, and then with our machine <unk> and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we have made a material using steel, separating these fibers, using the power of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, even you can double the life of the surface of the road, actually saving a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curiosity if it also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, it's got to cool first before I can show you how you can show you how it looks like.
But I'm going to do a go.
Let's take a look.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having me aroused one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to News News in his little gray.
I had a big smile in his face that was unusual at those time, because the news generally <unk>
"The Pakistani <unk> <unk> My dad.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he said.
One morning I'll never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Pakistani <unk> from Afghanistan and made the girls go to school.
For the next five years, I would tell you as a child to raise my older sister that I could no longer be outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two we could <unk>
Every day, you take a different route so that no one could be surprised where you would look for.
We had to hide the books in the market bags so that we were going shopping that we were <unk>
The school was at a house more than 100 of us in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> <unk>
We all knew that we would take our lives a teacher, the students and our parents.
In the time in a while, the school suddenly came up for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you <unk>
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters, a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan <unk> in which her daughter, my mother, would be at school and why her father <unk>
But my educated mother became mastery.
This is it.
He went back two years ago, just to convert our house in school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk in not to educate their kids.
For the years of the <unk> I remember there were moments where I was very frustrated for our life and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father would say, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in your life.
You can steal your money. You can put your house for a war.
But there's one thing that I'm going to be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will do it.
So you still want to do it either.
Today, I am 22 years.
I grew up in a country that's been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age have more than the school, and if my family hadn't been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find me proud of graduate school in <unk> College.
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from her home for the courage to educate her daughters, it was one of the first in <unk>
He's not just <unk> from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who I carry it on the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I sleep in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
This is why we <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see the students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, as the mine, I would go for them, despite the way in front of a opposition hole.
Like <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter would go on the way from <unk> to his village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the way for minutes.
When you get to your house, it's the phone, a voice noticed that if I still sent her daughter at school, I would go back to try.
<unk> now, if I <unk> he said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for their old and <unk> ideas."
And what I've been discharged in Afghanistan, and this is something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who <unk> there is a father who recognized the courage of his daughter and he sees that success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, often are the first compelling compelling future of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan -- we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who were to school are in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of change.
<unk> that these changes would not last much, after the retirement of the United States.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents that I <unk> for them, that <unk> I see a <unk> future and a <unk> change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> I would <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never have never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But I'll never go back a revolutionary <unk> <unk>
Now, have spent about two years since the revolution revealed inspired inspired by the DNA <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other <unk> citizens within and out of the country to call a day of <unk> and started a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a big revolution.
Women and young men were <unk> were at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a bravery <unk> to the <unk> of <unk>
They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, all the way down the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and a few loss of loss of about 50 percent died -- we managed to liberate our country and remove the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and the moral structure of <unk> society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I've wanted, alongside many other women, rebuild civil society -- <unk> a inclusive transition and fair to democracy and national realm.
So about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after every one of <unk> about 300 to <unk>
After a period of 33 years of <unk> I went back to Libya and with a unique, unique, I started organizing workshops about development development and skills of leadership.
With an amazing group of women we founded the <unk> of Women -- <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, <unk> orientation, to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and for our right participation right in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very hard environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was increasingly more and more <unk> than the selfish policies of states and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was <unk> and successful.
Women won a <unk> from the National Congress in 52 years.
However, little to little bit, the <unk> of elections and revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day to the news news <unk>
One day I woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of murder of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their paints of human rights rights and their lack of <unk>
Our society, made it for a revolutionary mindset, and it becomes more removed from the ideals of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here at all of us today to deal with our story of the success of <unk> <unk> and the elections.
Rather, I'm here today to tell you that we, as a nation, we choose evil, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize OK.
Because choices didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> between candidate and <unk> brought peace and <unk>
No, they didn't know.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with intuitive policies of domination and <unk> both for men as for women?
Maybe what was missing wasn't only women, but the cultural values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creating consensus more than the choices that we just need the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of sexual <unk> who need to be <unk> and <unk> of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call it a little bit of anger.
We need to begin to act as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, which not only <unk> but also put in practice <unk> rather than the <unk> of the competition, the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that an Libya, <unk> by war, desperately desperately need to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the <unk> and the <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in a existential way, before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the traditions of <unk> has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> that goes across the humanity that men and women, all tribes and all the villages have <unk>
And so just like the <unk> covers completely <unk> which is growing inside, the divine matrix of compassion is all the existence of it.
This is what my stethoscope looks like at all.
So you would tell us the <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
You know, all of you would be <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a happy question that has an equally <unk> answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is that everybody gets left?
Why would anyone stay with a man who would <unk>
I'm not <unk> or worker or an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that count.
I was 22 years old, I was <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first American green <unk> and I had a very big secret here.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I was creating my alma mater, I would join my head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man who loved anyone in this world, put a pistol in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times that I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap of love, where they fall down every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have a MBA in <unk> of <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for pharmaceutical companies, <unk> between them with Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been about 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all the world of income and education.
It's all over the place.
And my second message is that everybody thinks domestic violence goes to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> relationships and <unk> and said in another way, in the families, the last place where you would want or we would expect to find <unk> reason why, domestic abuse, turns out so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would stay with a man that hits him, and I actually went a very typical victim because of my age.
It was 22 years, and in the United States women were three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands on the United States.
I was also a typical victim, because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and rain night <unk>
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just <unk> from a university of <unk> <unk> and I was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But the most impressed me in that first meeting was that it was ready and fun, and that seemed a <unk>
I had a lot of big <unk> like apples, and a hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most smart things that he made <unk> from the beginning, was creating the illusion that I was the dominant component of the couple.
He did it about all the <unk> in a <unk>
We started getting out and loved all of me, who was ready to Harvard, that I had gone to Harvard, I would put passion to help teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know everything about my family my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had been done before.
And it was why the point in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much as much importance for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I left in New York and leaving the work of my dreams, but I thought that I had to do it for your couple, so I <unk> I left my work and <unk> and I went back to Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling on a <unk> <unk> who was coming from head in a financial trap. financial and psychological trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to.
And here's where they come into the scene those <unk>
How much as we moved to New England you know, that place where you were supposed to be so sure you bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
The other one was put on the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma who lived in a child.
I needed to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me and, although I had never lifted my hand. My life was already in serious <unk> every minute in every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven o'clock in the morning and still put the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I had the girlfriend of my mother and married me with him.
In spite of what had happened, I was sure that we were happy to be happy for the time, because I loved him, and he also wanted me to be a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was just a very little sense of <unk> for the wedding and the fact to form a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident and I never would even have any harm.
So I spent twice more on our moon of <unk>
And the first time I was driving up a secret beach, and I would tell you, and he gave me so strong in the head that I would take a number of times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our election of honey -- he went through the traffic and gave me a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point of life, and the Control Control Control informs that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I was very good company.
Going back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know that he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that I could help <unk> to face their <unk>
The other question all the world does is, why don't you simply be <unk>
Why don't I <unk> I could have been at any time.
And for me this is the most sad and painful question that people do, because we do the victims, we know something that normally you do, it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of domestic violence in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has put to relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include the permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to <unk> <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who usually are obliged for judges to spend time with the man who would go to their mother.
And we still keep asking why it's just not going on?
I was able to go back and I was able to go out of a final <unk> he would beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, I would have killed if there was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody in the world: the police, to my neighbors, my friends and family friends, and I'm here today because all of you are <unk>
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims of <unk> women <unk> <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are you <unk>
<unk> for some people is a way to say <unk> is it by <unk> as if the victims <unk> <unk> <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also <unk> that learned a <unk> lesson, of what happened and that they would take their lives and <unk> and <unk> lives and mothers, completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I am a victim and a survivor of domestic <unk>
I went back to marry a nice guy, and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to you to have never even more, you might be a <unk> pistol by my head of somebody who says I want.
And at this point, I just are thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time, I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, who are being <unk> or that they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> might be affecting their daughter, her sister, to her best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love of particular love the silence.
And I keep doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
Cows thrive only in silence.
They have the power to kill domestic violence simply throwing light over it.
The victims we need to all the world.
We need each of you understand the secret of domestic violence.
<unk> the stream to light talking about it with their children, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors like fantastic people who have a <unk> future.
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims a safe tool.
Together, we can convert our beds, our tables and our families in the <unk> and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call me Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this point there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have myself dressed like this.  Luckily, I've brought it back to <unk>
This is the first change of clothing on a stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are going to be <unk> when they don't have to be <unk> now, but I find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege to be able to change what you think about me in as only 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that chance.
These ranches are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to go through this sweater, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything as you cover my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I would take the back and I would take the hair out of the guy.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> as I did two days ago for the work, there are very little that we can do it to transform our way -- which, though shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, will be brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I am a model.
Because I'm a nice and white, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in a <unk> form.
The first question is, how does it come to be model?
And I always say, a <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason that I made a model is because I won the genetics, and I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this is?
Well, in the last few centuries. We have not only defined the beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed to <unk> we also have been associated with a high and <unk> shape and <unk>
And that's my cultural <unk> that I've known to leverage the money.
And I know there are people in the audience that now show <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that <unk> <unk> <unk> There are <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> to know so much models of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told all and each of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> which is less than four percent, were not killed.
The next question that people always ask me is to be able to be a model when you can imagine.
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
But then what I would really tell you to every one of these girls is: Why?
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be impressive, as you are the first one.
If after this spectacular list is still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of <unk> American magazine or the <unk> executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be a model to say that you want to win the lottery.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work that you can choice.
I'm going to show you all I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Sadly, once you've got your studies, you know, and you have a copy and a few work on your backs, no matter what you're going to do, is to say, if you pretend that you want to be president of the United States, but your copy is <unk> Model <unk> for 10 years, people would look at you.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, pretty much <unk> all the photographs, but that's just a little part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I told me and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're going to be on a personal terrain, but it was a little girl.
So I was looking at my grandmother a few months before.
These two photos are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I'm at a <unk> party a few days before the photos for the French.
Here I'm with my football team and <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those photos.
They are creations of a professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and get this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people will always ask me is to make things for free?
I have too many three inches. And I never use, except the couple of them, but the privileges that I get to get the ones that I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a grocery store, and I forgot to take money, and I was taken for free <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped a red light and of course, and <unk> a sorry, agent to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges privilege that I think is -- and there are people who are paying a price for their opinion, no matter who they are.
I live in New York City and last year of the <unk> adolescents who stood up and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there's only <unk> young black young black and Latino in New York City, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
But how many times <unk>
When I was looking for this talk, I learned that to 80 percent of the age of 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is life in a model?
And I think the answer you're waiting for is: If you're a little thinner and you have the most brilliant hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to be able to work with creative people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never told you is, I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever say, with some more thin legs and the most brilliant hair will be happier?
They only have to get together with a group of models, because they have the most unhealthy legs and the more the fashion -- but it's probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to look at a situation of racial and gender oppression when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something to retain in this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable by recognizing the power of the image in the perception that we have about success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was most enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 photos more <unk> and I wasn't me who <unk>
There were no <unk> directors or no chance to repeat the photographs, not even a little care on the enlightenment.
In fact, most of them took them out of random tourists randomly.
My story begins in the city of New York to give a <unk> my wife gave me this picture, holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and five.
I happened to go back to New York just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you back to New York on a <unk> trip and you go the <unk>
Here's when we started asking the tourists that they were going to get us out the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of getting the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has been denied and luckily, no one has <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much we would change life this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is about a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that day a little girl could be understood.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop the time in a week of October and to make us think about our age and our evolution over the years, and not only to physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through their eyes and how to perceive and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, in one of travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, she stopped in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the grocery store, which <unk> of small in <unk>
And he described to me what I felt about five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that remembered his heart <unk> with strength to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created are memories.
So I want to share the idea of engaging in creating conscious of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 photos I don't go out in a lot of family pictures.
I'm always getting the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you don't want to go up with somebody and asked, you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk>
First of all, why do you have such a bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughter as <unk> silly stupid.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, <unk> and <unk> these are the attributes that they associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. Do you know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent <unk>
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are mainly in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> where we have 16 species of extinction.
So, why are you <unk> they're important, First of all, provide severe ecological services.
It's our <unk> of natural <unk>
<unk> the people up to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria they help absorb the anthrax that of not being allowed to be allowed to have severe loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> people take three to four times more <unk> and this has huge ramifications of <unk> disease.
<unk> also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the <unk> symbol, and the Incredible and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the Alto and <unk> Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> it was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, they do a few very important <unk> to open open sky in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination
What's the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, <unk> are victims of this.
In the south of Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan and four species of <unk> are in the critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years <unk> and the reason is because they fall out of the consumer consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned for <unk> in India and have taken a minds.
Because there is no <unk> there have been a spread in the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs -- and when you have <unk> dogs -- and when you have <unk> dogs -- the number of anger has grown enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest parks wind at <unk> <unk> <unk> are going to be up the <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this at the birds.
They're <unk> birds.
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade trade, dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what is he doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that travel in different countries, so to focus on a domestic problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments in <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we <unk>
How can you help us help make noise, make noise, you can write a letter to your government and tell you, we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures -- their time to spread the word <unk> the word.
When you go out of this room, you will report about the <unk> but talk to their families, with your children, with your neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed from opinion because he saw it without <unk> without energy yield in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Each thing I do and everything I do with my life -- it's been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young ones, but I am no --   I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa of <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project we set up in Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> the 21, that Italians were good people and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that I would do with it.
So our first project that I inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where we had a lot, we decided to teach people in Zambia to grow food.
So we got <unk> <unk> south of Zambia to the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends towards the <unk> River and we teach local tomatoes and <unk> and <unk>
And of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so I would ask them to come to work, and some times, they didn't <unk>  We were in addition to the local, in that <unk> valley, didn't have had been agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we could not make it, but we said, "Thank God we're standing here --  <unk> time to save the people in the <unk>
And of course, all in Africa were <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a less tomato tomato soup to this size.
And we couldn't believe them, we were telling the <unk> "Look at how easy the <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night at the morning, about 200 <unk> came out from the river and ate it.  And we said to the <unk> "God <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here,  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
I thought that we would only have errors <unk> errors in Africa, but then, I saw what the words were doing, what they were doing, and then to see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in <unk>
Because, as you can see at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to look at the <unk>  <unk> look at the waste that we gave the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, reading <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, countries countries, we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about damage that that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage that we've done.
The Westerners -- we are <unk> missionaries <unk> and we treat people only two things: or the <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words came out of the root Latin root that means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I treat any of a different culture as if my children, "I want you a lot."
<unk> I treat all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So whites in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face of the face -- "You're a little <unk> written by <unk> who said about all of economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of help is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference on the floor and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to have 27 years just to respond to people, and invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never started talking about you, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have sleep to a better person.
So what do you do? You get <unk>
You will never go to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We sat down in a cafe. We sat in a pub.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do this?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for their own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find the knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, as opposed to a community to tell the people what to do, why not, for once, for once, but not in community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
<unk> never <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity you have <unk>
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't take their public meetings.
What do we do? We work -- and we work on a face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
So the profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor of the business, who are combined with you in your home, at the coffee table, and you help find the resources to transform your passion in a form of a <unk>
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia City.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this <unk> trash where we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects on the march, and the government came up to me to say, "How can you do that?
How can we do that? And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
I'm going to tell you --       So the government says, <unk> again.  We've done in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped you start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business corporate American skilled American skilled American <unk>
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they were involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a global <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of death of the global spirit.
So now <unk> reconstructing <unk> without knowing what people most <unk> in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to talk to you.
You have to offer you for you, and tell you, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we have 200 <unk>
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What have you heard of, you know, more this tomorrow?
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I'm telling you is that the emotional spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial industrial revolution -- fossil <unk> <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a form of sustaining <unk> it's not sustainable.
What we need to consider, is how do we <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for the green revolution -- the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
You'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a particularly beautiful story that I read many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> you gathered this group of people and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population stays growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to <unk> <unk> six million horses. and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that would be <unk> in New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in United States came up with <unk> anonymous companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
In other way, they won't come to speak to you.
And then you have to offer you a absolute devoted <unk>
And then later you have to tell you the truth with about <unk>
The smallest company, the largest company, the largest company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell you has to be fantastic, you have to tell you with a fantastic marketing and you have to tell you with a great financial administration.
Do you know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that I can do, to sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This was not born.
We've tested and looked at the 100 <unk> companies in the <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford, all the new, Google <unk>
There's just one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one was started by one person.
I never had the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it started.
Nobody begins a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> in bars alongside their devoted <unk> who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who talks about about this <unk> somebody who would ask you, what would it?
What can you do? Can you do that?
Okay, so you can look at it. Can you look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
The people around us can help us so many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all of the neighbors -- so we don't change a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and ask to borrow more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do we share more memories from our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes for greenhouse stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York City, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> who are described by <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always gives me the music.  There is a <unk> in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the largest number of abandoned <unk>
I live near this house and I thought how it would make it in a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and <unk>
I thought a lot of death and I thought a lot about death and I thought a lot.
And this led me a deep gratitude for the time and the time that I lived up with.
It gave him the significant things of my current life.
But let me keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to go out to be catching up the day to day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant <unk> and he painted on her phrases to <unk> Before they died <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to expect this experiment, but the next day the wall was <unk> and I kept <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I died I want to be <unk>  Before I died I want to sit in the line of <unk> change.
Before I died I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I died I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died I want to live out of the <unk>
Before I died I want to give you a more."
Before I died I want to go to the rescue rescue.
Before I died I want to be totally myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people were asked me laughing <unk> and gave me comfort in tough moments.
It's about to know that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new and <unk> and it's trying to accommodate the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to do a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center we did a kit and now have been made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
Together, we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things that we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distractions online, it's more important than ever, to find the ways to conserve the perspective and remember that life is brief and <unk>
death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that it was preparing for death is one of those things that we would get more power.
If you think about death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect what we care about as individuals and as a community and more media and more media to share hope, and the people around us can't only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 and very hot.
I don't talk about, but transmits joy that some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It shares what happens to happen.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color color.
It doesn't matter the religious differences, and notice this is never <unk>
When I sing the songs of our childhood, trying to <unk> words that I don't even want to do, it reminds me of a thing that we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that should be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but remember the year that I came out every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years, I would be <unk> in my arm during the first episode of <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It's not <unk>
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because your minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, often are <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although they wouldn't consider them in the <unk> that would only mean one thing: They would only mean <unk>
Now, for those less familiar -- with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical abilities.
In each individual it manifests in a different form of a different way of us from that <unk> it will be as different to Sam.
And everywhere in the world, every 20 minutes, a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster increases in the world, there's no cause no <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new being in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
It was a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in their own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars in row around the room, to look at the machine and eat anything that was <unk>
As I was growing up, it would come back, and the differences were getting more politicians.
But beyond the <unk> frustration and <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature, a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being had never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny which there have been some hard moments in my family, moments that I would have wish that they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change the normal.
The beauty goes through the beauty that give us the differences, and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It only means that there's a different view of what's correct.
If I could <unk> a single thing to <unk> and Sam and you would have to be normal to you.
You can be remarkable.
Whether autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> each of us has a gift on their inside and, to be honest, the search for normal is the ultimate <unk>
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change in the time we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what it must have been <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a teacher of communications asked me a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared --  <unk> <unk> <unk> of these students with their big minds, their big books and the unknown books and unknown words.
But when they developed those conversations, I sat out what I would have sense when he fell through the hole of the rabbit and saw the door of a new world.
I just sat myself when I had those conversations with the students. They surprised me the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication.
We need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are attacking our larger challenges from energy to the environment and care of health, and if we don't know we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please do it with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
We don't tell us simply that we study the <unk> but we study the <unk> which are the mesh structure of our bones, because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care with <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't we say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> <unk> It's not the same thing that I <unk>
Instead, as he said, Einstein, that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging the ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- they're ways of turning and <unk> with their content.
And when I present their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
They have wondered why they're called <unk>  What do you do the <unk> you kill them and <unk> your presentation.
An <unk> like this is not just boring, but it supports too much in the area of the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that actually inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
So the trick here is to use a simple phrase that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphics that we will go to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what they <unk>
I think these are just some keys that can help us open the door, and we see the country of the wonders that is science and engineering engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've been solved this equation, all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the U.S. English is <unk>
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Though there was an editor <unk> from the 19th century that defined a lot of better when he said, "A <unk> is that you search for <unk> no matter or not, and that, when I win it by the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
One thing to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that the words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that have to try and master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to mention the exact words that were said on the <unk> chamber.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the word name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by <unk>
They put him in the Torre London in London and <unk> but he had enough bravery to face them, and at the end, he had such a popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of you think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for a advocate of the freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and policy interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to address the issue of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk>
This was <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were presented all sorts of suggestions that might have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it a <unk> state of <unk> and then <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the American <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some people simply wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was proven quality.
And not even with that were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given reference.
And there might be <unk>
All of the world would be tired of <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
He read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives were against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call it King because he gave him or her <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give you the more <unk> and more <unk> and more <unk>
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. There was before, but it only meant <unk> that we would have a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> and it was really a <unk>
And so the Senate <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
And who is going to take you in serious and <unk> and <unk> as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite thing to where I've been able to figure out the Senate has never been <unk>
President Barack Obama has luck to keep there waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to stay waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important, and I want to tell you -- is that the title of President of America doesn't sound at all that modest today, right?
And especially if you have more than five nuclear heads to disposal, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of <unk> <unk>
And the story and the story has seen the title of <unk>
So at the end, I won the <unk>
They got their <unk>
And the other concern about the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness at the time.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear body, etc.
So at the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel a humble when you say that you're the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to do with you to <unk>
The politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control the reality, but actually, we change it much more -- the words that these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters under land in an illegal mine.
The air is hotter and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but most of all, that cacophony of male <unk> and stones were <unk> with primitive.
Like each other, I carry a cheap <unk> of light -- she would lead to my head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the branches of that hole in a subway that falls up hundreds of meters on the ground.
And I took my hand out and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met a few days before, who had lost control and fell countless meters on that hole.
And while I talk to you today, these men are in the deep age of risking their lives without paying or reward and, often, dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they might never will, because they're <unk>
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures over over 70 countries and 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
Amongst all the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO who has to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not at a grade.
And when we end up talking to me very evil, I was happy to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> the stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the head of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to the modern slavery.
Interestingly, there was a lot of these places.
Some of them, even the thought my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty ones.
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people <unk> in the world.
It's twice as much of the number of African Africans during all of the slave of <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a slave slave was about three times the <unk> salary of a U.S. worker worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 <unk>
However, today you can solve all the entire families for the cost of 18 18.
<unk> the slavery generates more than 13,000 dollars a year across the world.
Many have been <unk> with false <unk> promises and better work to find that they are obliged to work without pay, low threat of violence and can't escape.
Today slavery works in <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce are disposable them.
The slavery exists in almost the world and yet it's illegal throughout the world.
In India and Nepal, I met <unk> <unk>
This weird show and <unk> was like entering the ancient Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at a temperature of 54 C, men, women, children in fact, entire families -- in a <unk> <unk> <unk> abandoned blocks in their heads, and they took them from <unk> <unk> to trucks that are hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> they work at silence, doing this task again and again for 16 hours -- 17 hours a day.
There was no <unk> to eat, or to drink, and the severe <unk> would make it quite <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a better treatment better than these people.
Back in the <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly and grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And I explained very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation that they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and to work inside the system for their liberation and he complained that he was <unk>
I waited to get home to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found <unk> children carrying stones for a mile for <unk> to trucks that were waiting at the bottom.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children who were killed, and the children put them up with their heads with <unk> <unk> made from <unk> ropes ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They don't have anything to do it.
When these villagers were <unk> their freedom, the <unk> they had completely cut their home.
When you hear the word slavery often we think of sexual traffic and because of this global conscience, told me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been <unk> sexual <unk>
It took me out of a little <unk> who gave this <unk> <unk> <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more well a restaurant.
<unk> as it is known in craft, they're local.
They have small rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of us just seven -- they're forced to convince clients and to buy more food and alcohol.
Every put is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
People are often suffering abuse of their clients.
From foot in the <unk> I remember there were sense of <unk> <unk> and, in that moment, I could barely imagine what it should be caught in that hell.
I only had a <unk> the stairs why I <unk>
There was no <unk>
There was no big windows like <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because you touch a hard topic -- it's important to point out that slavery even sexual transit, it happens to us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 thousand children are sold to every year as sex sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles are another activity that often interact with the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families in the trade trade.
This is a family.
The hands of black hands are from the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of their kids.
<unk> <unk> in these large barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me their stories.
"We have no <unk> they said.
We hope we expect it to go out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the lake.
When we got there, I got a quick look fast.
I saw what it seemed to be a family of fishermen in a boat, two older brothers -- a few young children, a few young children.
<unk> were all slaves.
The children are separated from their <unk> families and forced to work on a large part of these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up with was <unk> I mean, his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling in the water.
<unk> branches of trees tend to be on Lake <unk> they often catch networks and to <unk> and fear and fear of water to release the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
By fear of her love is not going to flee and, as every life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> is the youngest slave under his command.
I met these guys at the five o'clock in the morning, when we took the last networks, but they had been working out from the last networks, but they had been working out from the <unk>
In the cold night and <unk>
And it fits to point out that these networks are over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi is the possible.
Who will get to be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> for a road in Ghana with <unk> friends of <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his bike. suddenly <unk> and <unk> our car and played the window.
It asked us to do it on a path of land to the forest.
At the end of the way, we were going to go out of the car, and asked the driver to go out quickly.
And then I'll signal this path just visible and said, "This is the path, this is the road.
So as we started to go down, we took the <unk> that I put up the path and after walking close to an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of pictures about my head as I would go on in these waters to the chest.
And after two hours of <unk> the <unk> road ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a number of holes that I could fit in a football field, and everybody were full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied their back, and, as they were looking for gold, <unk> on <unk> <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in his own <unk>
I remember her eyes tired, <unk> because many had been on land for 72 hours.
The pits have to 90 feet, and these people carry <unk> heavy bags that then will be transported to another area where they <unk> the rock to be able to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if we look at more closely at the side, we see the other <unk> and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of tuberculosis and the <unk> for a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died he took him to work with him in mines.
By dying his uncle, <unk> <unk> the debt of the uncle who force it to be slave in mines.
When I met, I worked on the mines 14 and the lesion of the leg that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so serious that doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet, to that, is forced to work and day in that mine.
And yet, he would be released and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of airtime of a face to a remote possibility that inspired me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on the slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen by you everywhere in the world.
I wanted to know that we knew that we would have testimony and we're going to make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really think that if we can see us each other like human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not magazines. They're real people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I happen to happen that I don't think about these many beautiful people that I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images wake up a force in which you see them in people like you, and I hope that that strength will turn a fire and that <unk> light on the slavery -- because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do applied math and there is a particular problem for the <unk> we are like management administration.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activities of activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk>  that we will see later on.
But <unk> demand for extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably some initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Sadly, raw disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's Parkinson's <unk> gradually this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a virtuous <unk>
In the last few years, it's been a lot of a lot in the treatment.
But there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we know if there's a cure to be when we have an objective and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's disease, and other disorders of movement there is no <unk> <unk> so they don't serve blood analysis and the best thing that we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that out of clinical trials, never has never been done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test <unk>
It wouldn't be <unk>
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars.
So what I want to do, as a conventional way, you see, in a sense at least, all of us are <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of vibration <unk>
It shows someone healthy as it emits sounds to you, we can imagine as the dancers of a vocal ballet because we need to coordinate all of those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes for example.
And as the <unk> requires an extraordinary training level.
So let's think of the time that leads to a child to learn to talk.
So from the sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as <unk> and like Parkinson's affects the <unk> also affects the <unk>
On the bottom line you can see an example of <unk> from the <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do we compare these tests based on the voice with <unk> clinical trials are both <unk>
<unk> <unk> isn't <unk> Both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both of them are accurate. Well, but also the tests of <unk> they are not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
It's low cost, and we all know what happens.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it shows at massive scale.
These are some amazing goals for <unk>
We can reduce the hard difficulties on the patient.
I wouldn't have to go to the clinic for the <unk>
With high monitoring we could get a data on goals.
We could make a huge cost of low cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it is too late.
So when I give you the first steps in that sense, we're launching the <unk> <unk> disease.
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to tackle these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> or without Parkinson's disease, it can call low price and put recordings for a few cents. And I'm happy to pretend that we have reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So let's take all these samples out of, say, 10,000 people will be able to say who are healthy and who isn't it?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What's happening is that during the call you have to indicate whether you have or not the disease. Sure.
<unk> You see, some people can not afford it. You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data, in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances, is important because we're looking for <unk> factors in search of the actual markers of the disease.
TR: They have a <unk> precision at this moment?
<unk> A lot more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to have a fantastic job and now it's been shown that it works in the mobile phone network, also what the project. Now we have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's <unk>
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March from the 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're <unk> gray.
We are going on in the darkness, on no windows and, usually we avoid the solar light.
We do the political models even more <unk> the perfect perfect skin even more perfect, we do the impossible possible and we get into the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of experience and a real taste for images and photography.
September 11 of the 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that happen in Japan.
Soon the time later, an organization where it was <unk> There were <unk> <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the <unk>
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay sitting in home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13 I traveled to <unk>
It's a small <unk> village in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people -- one of the first people affected by the wave.
The level of water recorded it reached over 24 feet high, and more than three miles out there.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
<unk> debris from the channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the slime out and we left the house ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took <unk> tons and tons of fish fish -- <unk> <unk> from the local factory <unk>
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, so much the volunteers like the neighbors found the same thing.
They found pictures and <unk> pictures and cameras and cards.
They all did the same.
<unk> and bring them to different places of the villages around to <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures made a huge part of the personal losses that that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon anything that they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a center of <unk> of the people.
It helped clean the bathrooms out there, the enormous, giant <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor that that day I would go on to hand the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I'd heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until we moved myself my horizons that something happened.
When I look at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years -- some of them still were in the lab on the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
So that night I walked onto Facebook came up with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first one of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl I had to go with a lot of precision and <unk>
In the other way, that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as you have the photo <unk>
Over the time of time, they got a little bit more pictures and they needed more <unk> so I walked back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries were offered to help.
At two weeks I was 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a village neighbor to the north of <unk>
Once the week is we use our scanner in the time interactive libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, dependent on course the <unk> of the photos.
I could get an hour. I could make a couple of weeks.
I could make a few months.
This <unk> had to draw practically by hand using a guide the areas whose color and detail that water hadn't destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures would be <unk> <unk> and <unk> with seaweed, and even with oil -- all of that together with the time of the time I continue to be able to get to hand it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless they were clean, dry and would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We had luck with <unk>
We have a guide to a <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more <unk>
As once once said, the leader of my group is how to make a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures to be lucky to the photos.
I had started <unk> she would have been stopped by realizing that <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her own husband and his own face would have been <unk> we could <unk> the images in a single picture, and <unk> the full picture.
When I picked up their pictures shared something of their story with us.
A few colleagues in her husband found the pictures in a fire station between a very far far of where he used to be his home, but his colleagues would <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their small children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
It took a week to find all his family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her their photographs her lower son would be drawn up.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could go back to look, something that I could remember from the past that didn't have been destroyed by that day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers were attached to the <unk> hundreds of <unk> photographs -- the great <unk> -- the great majority came out of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers from all the world helped us back to 90 percent, hundreds of photos of fully <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we didn't spend more than <unk> in teams and materials, most of the ink for <unk>
We take pictures constantly.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, a place, a relationship, someone wish you want.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would let us look for it.
And about this was the project to restore small pieces of humanity, from giving someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to someone, a huge difference in the life of the person that is coming in.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected them with something larger, to give you something larger, using your talent for something that are not perfect <unk>
To end up I'd like to read this electronic email -- I sent it Cindy that day I came back from six months.
As I could, I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the pictures.
In particular, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl and a little girl gathering around a baby, I was <unk> because a little bit of my family -- my grandmother, my mother, and my daughter <unk> <unk> from our wall.
In the entire world, in all the few our basic needs are the same. Right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> I inspired awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that comes through an apple in an exhibition of just a millionth of a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion. It's a billion frames per second.
Let me introduce you a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technical technique that can create video on a slow camera in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and challenging the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I turned it up, and you put it into a <unk> <unk> or a number of <unk> create a package of photons just a millimeter millimeter in a wide millimeter size.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common <unk>
If you take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do you disperse those photons into this <unk>
What's the aspect of the light in <unk>
Now, all of this --   Remember, all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola didn't take this research --  <unk> many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle, with a swarms of photons that starts to <unk> and that inside, starts to <unk>
Part of the light is going on the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of the air that bounces up inside.
In that time, the waves travel on the table, and because of the insights of the top part of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights are <unk>
Now, if you take a common bullet and we make it go the same distance and we see it in a slow way to about 10 billion times, how much people think that we would take to see that movie?
One day? One week, actually.
It would be a very boring film,  from a slow <unk>
And what about testing with nature <unk>
You can see the waves coming out of the table, the <unk> and the wall of the background.
It's like throwing a rock on a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a picture, I thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at one time, this tomato will realize that, as the light gets rid of the tomato <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces up in his inside and it becomes after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What is we created this camera at MIT?
As photographers, you know, if you take a low exposure, it comes up very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest exposure than the shortest exposure -- so you can barely go into some light.
We send that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded it again and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> data and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw and <unk>
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a future would be allowed to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light out of light on the door, and I would go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera there.
Where we could get those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already build.
The left is our <unk>
Behind the wall there's a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
So after the post of our article in <unk> <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different moments.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique <unk>
It has very good resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door, and also to the hidden objects but we don't know what point corresponds to the distance.
By projecting a laser can record a laser picture, which you see on the screen, it doesn't really have any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, tens of images, the <unk> and we will try to look at the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
We can see it in <unk>
This is our rebuilding this.
We have things to explore before we get this from the laboratory, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's going around the <unk>
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected by the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> we could see the inside of the body using <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue, and the blood is quite difficult -- so actually this is a request to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new settlement of visualization to solve the problems of developing health care problem.
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, became art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data we collect every time is not only for scientific <unk> but we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have scientific <unk>
We create a new form of computational photograph with slow and color code.
And look at those <unk> remember the time between each one of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here's something fun.
If we look at the waves under the <unk> these are going on from us.
<unk> should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order of the events in the world sometimes appears to the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warps of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can delay life, and gives you an individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime crime against humanity on Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone you can record a song, it goes up to <unk> and <unk>
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> in 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people decided that I would go to you in search for a change, you had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who is a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a <unk>
It's a lot of a mobile phone.
But today I'm talking about my phone, and how do I change my life.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 sets of information.
<unk> <unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> of <unk>
This tells you that every single mobile phone company -- every meal of all Europe, has to store a broad range of information from users.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends him a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company or the Internet provider or their <unk>
And across Europe, people stood up and said, "We want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone and the Internet providers, all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin, and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of the people even said that this would be <unk> gratification.
The <unk> was the secret police in the Eastern continents.
And I also asked myself if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> that in that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, which please give me a whole information that I had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to ask him, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all blah blah.
But then I said, "I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to get a lawsuit to court because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, "We don't give you this information.
At the end, I <unk> a second.
<unk> the demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Veterans' Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly in brown with a CD inside.
And on the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand people <unk> as much of the information lines.
At first, I watched them and said, well, it's a big file. Okay.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this file.
It was a little <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I spend the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to <unk>
I want to make it <unk>
Because I want to show people what the retention <unk> means.
So next to <unk> <unk> and Open <unk> City, did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom up and go forward and go back and forward.
You can see every step I give it.
And you can see how I'm going to go on a train to <unk> and what often I call in the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we talk a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call them between them.
And then one calls the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this great network network.
You can see how their people communicate to each other, what time they call each other to what time you sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this data, you can see what's doing society.
If you have access to this data, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who's talking about who you send an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at first, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall, they had a mobile phone in our pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who I met in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin House would never have happened.
And a result, neither is the <unk> of <unk>
Because today the state states and companies want to store as much information from us as possible within and out of the website.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and want to be <unk> forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital era is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to home with your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not a lot of fashion.
When you go home, you go to their representative of your representative than just because companies and state agencies can store some data, you don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information they produce.
So in the future, every time you use your cell phones that it is to remember that you have to fight for <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
So as a result, I have cerebral palsy, so we would go all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mix of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
<unk> C. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> you can't <unk>
No one <unk> the <unk> of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, although they are.
It only happens for accidents, as I came to birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of the present there.
I sit wrong for me, because at some point of life, you've wanted to be disabled.
Let's walk.
<unk> Christmas, are in the commercial center, driving in circles in search of parking parking lot, and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and <unk> C is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same number.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York to do it.
Many people have cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three sisters would go to public school, my parents would go to the school system and <unk> that I would also be, and if we didn't know all the ultimate note all the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at five years to put my <unk> in their feet and just walking.
The other step that I was using was to hang a dollar in front of me to make it <unk>
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and <unk>
Yeah. The first day in the night I walked up to walk as a <unk> <unk> which has received a lot of <unk>
By growing up, there were only six Arab in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they're all in the family.  I think no one realized we weren't <unk>
This was before September 11, and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as <unk>
The people that I grew up didn't have trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed to be <unk> a lot of hunger died during the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating, so <unk> the dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends wear <unk>
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of <unk> I wasn't going to go.
I would spend my summers in a war zone, because my parents worried that if we don't go to Palestine all the <unk> we would go to <unk>
In the summer vacation I often tried my father trying to <unk> so I would drink milk in my back, and I would drink warm cups on the back, and I remember the water gave me my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> <unk> was the yoga.
I should say that it's very boring, but before we make yoga <unk> it was a comedian comedian that I couldn't stand up <unk>
And now I can play it in my head.
My parents would take this idea that I could do anything, which any dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through the positive discrimination and I got a scholarship for the University of Arizona, because it came up in all the <unk>
It was like <unk> pet from the theater.
I all <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the top note in my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass zoo of crystal my <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a piece called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a piece of girl with cerebral palsy,
I was a girl with cerebral palsy,
So I started screaming at the four <unk> I can finally have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of it. At the end of it.
Thank God <unk> in the end I'm <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  He gave him a <unk>
I went to <unk> running at the director of the theater, crying crying -- historically, as if someone had killed my cat, to ask her why and she told me that because they thought I could do the <unk>
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk, you can't do the <unk>
It was a piece of paper that literally had been born and gave an actor without cerebral palsy,
The college was actually embracing my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors, actors for a disabled papers for a disabled.
When I went back home, and my first <unk> <unk> was as extra in a <unk>
My dream came true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> <unk> friend in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see it more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that directors of <unk> didn't make any <unk> <unk>
Just to give you the perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour, I took Hollywood comics from New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first line that I took when he fell at high speed on the highway of New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral palsy,
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic, in the Middle East, without <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you have never heard that little nasty rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find them very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> in New York City now in his 10.
So our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and time to remind them directors that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> the Arab was much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news news for wire it has come back with Keith <unk>
And I went out to a graduate dance as if I went to a graduate school, I would go to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I met at the desk desk to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they would never get me.
But not only Mr. <unk> came back to <unk> but I was just like a full time and hit my chair.
Something a lot of fun that I learned on right with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It tells you that children are <unk> but I never had to stand up with me or a little girl or more.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
<unk> clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> <unk>
What disease is that?
We should really pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> can't make someone in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yeah, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of the entertainment.
The doctors said that not <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, we have grown up with media media, I don't think that I <unk>
I hope we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there was more positive images, that would be less <unk>
Or maybe not.
Maybe we even need the whole society to teach our kids.
My <unk> has taken me to very spectacular places.
I went to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I was going to be in a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give the Palestinian refugee kids a little bit of what my parents would tell me.
It was the only time my father saw me live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I would like to tell you a story about a child in a young village.
I don't know her name, but I know his story.
It lives in a small village south of <unk>
This village is about <unk>
<unk> drives the small village to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it's going to the big city in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, no <unk> no <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he told him a man who gives him to take it to <unk> after dinner, <unk>
He knows a dynamic group of people who gives him a place.
It's a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home, her family.
He presented a young lady.
They finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky containing a bomb.
That kid from that little village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist terrorist and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a terrorist organization with the Qaeda.
So how is the story of a child in a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start their future, waiting a perspective perspective, and this was the first thing that he arrived.
This was the first thing that took him out of what we call "the <unk> period.
And its story over the city centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban urban urban urban urban urban <unk> riots in London, which are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young, the promise of the city -- the great dream of the city is the opportunity of the opportunity -- of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from higher rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people who live in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't hear them opportunities the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terror, to the violence -- to <unk> to the history of 2.0 cities.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They don't do virtually anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember going to be at that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I had never left?
And if I had been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason that I was in <unk> that month was actually to support a few youth leaders in a business rate.
It would be about 90 leaders juveniles <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There were no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me that because I was a college college student <unk> frustrated, was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get to the point B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have been completely destroyed and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a company of <unk>
It started <unk> motorcycle to local residents who normally couldn't <unk>
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is sometime to expand hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new chance.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think that business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so long.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who went to one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of the corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business leaders.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in the age of 22 years, and until a little bit, until Mohamed got flowers to your <unk> <unk> we were plastic sent from abroad.
If you got to somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
I created a farm in the outskirts of <unk> and started to grow <unk> and <unk> that he said, could survive the hard <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers to wedding -- creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies and now is working on the creation of the first public park in 22 years.
There's no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where they young people, they can go together, and, as he says, sniff out the pink <unk>
By the way, he's not <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young ones, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on the young.
They had never thought of starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO to work for government, but their story -- their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
<unk> to believe that they might be <unk> that might be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So to inspire young people and create a culture of business that is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation for <unk> in development and put on their business.
<unk> young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support that need to move from understanding to the creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something else to start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her Park <unk> that's how it called, when it's created, we will transform the way that people see their city.
<unk> hired children from the street to help rent and keep the bikes for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to make young people in <unk> <unk> and eat their innovation, and they'll have more stories about flowers and Parks of <unk> that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about ten years and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area <unk> north of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was doing that the leaves <unk> as a <unk> and not to be the way that we would <unk> almost to pretend that we were the first human beings on pressing that land.
We came to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> with sight of a beautiful lake.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four meters with <unk> <unk> balls of aluminum paper and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very pissed down, incredibly <unk>
<unk> who were too lazy as to pull out what they thought they were going to clean their <unk>
That question followed me, and I got a little bit.
Who cleans our <unk>
No matter how they <unk> or where they <unk> the <unk> who cleans our trash in <unk>
Who cleans our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York City, the Department of <unk> <unk> our trash for <unk> tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to know how individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked out of his trajectories and interviewed people in offices and I learned a lot, but I was still a <unk>
Do you need to get a little bit more.
So I started to work like <unk> trash.
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I'm the <unk>
And they operated <unk> mechanics.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as <unk> as you believe -- and in the days that it's very strong you will be <unk>
It costs a lot of used to weight.
I met people who had been working on it for several years, and their bodies kept <unk> to the weight of taking over their own tons of trash every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the <unk> Office Office is one of the ten <unk> of the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and go in the traffic all day and pass it around you.
They just want to warn you, so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for <unk>
And then the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck.
I also learned about the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the trash is like a force of nature in it.
Never stop coming.
It's also like a kind of breathing or circulation.
It's always supposed to be moving.
And there's the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is particularly ironic because I think strongly that the <unk> of waste are the most important workforce in the streets streets for three reasons.
It's the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of <unk> and effective every day, this starts to <unk> from their <unk> and their dangers are <unk> in very real forms.
Control we had controlled for decades and centuries.
The economics needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have space for what the motors of the economy begin to fail when it's at danger the consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just pointed out your relationship.
And then there's what I call our average average speed that we need.
So I mean just the speed that we used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't <unk> no <unk> or we get with us our cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forgot about them, because we know that there is a work force on the other side to be done.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about waste of waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a city and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They are on the street every day in the street.
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when you <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
It's almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us apart from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow always must stay in one form or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste gathering on the street, grabbed my little little little <unk> and I fell down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing her journey of piece of paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to do his work that day in particular, but I started to cry.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and he said, "We're going to be fine.
Let's be OK."
And shortly after that I started looking at the gathering of waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together so many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that he was correct.
Let's be fine.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species we need to include and have all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor labor.
The city waste that we think when we talk about <unk> represent three percent of the <unk>
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one who would see somebody whose work is clean the trash of you, I will take a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you very much.
My work focuses on the connection to think of our physical life to be part of the environment where architecture are born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
In addition, they share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a mall center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many of these buildings in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, it takes a lot to use a lot of energy because of the <unk> of <unk> heat heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's about a climate of 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year.
And third of all, his view has nothing to do with Africa not with Ethiopia.
It's a worthy of a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, was really <unk> with the old market that is this structure to the free air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using the public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the thing was how to build a modern <unk> of various stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the site, the site, which is located in a area of a very much growth area of the city where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the picture, not exist yet.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing that we did was create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entries in the building.
And this spreads with a <unk> <unk> which creates a space to the free air in the building that they will be destroyed by its own form of the sun and the <unk>
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with small business, which changes in every floor due to the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we went to the local financial conditions.
And I got to think of a similar tissue to a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the air, and also the light, but in a <unk> way?
We then inspire us in these beautiful buttons of <unk> <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry. And this helped me model <unk>
We're building that with these little pieces of pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way running inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little crystals of colors that use the light inside of the building to light the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- it wasn't what I did.
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the commercial center because in order to bank there were more local to <unk>
And then the idea of the facade was a huge economic of <unk> not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to be <unk>
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power of energy for the building in a city where electricity was cut almost every day.
So we got a big advantage to putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, who are collect water for the <unk>
It's waiting for the principles of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan for 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a big project, the biggest thing that I have designed, I need not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its tradition and culture.
During that analysis I made special attention in the <unk> a structure of 1,000 years of ancient years that was surrounded by a wall with 12 doors connected by lines over almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first of design design that we did was expand the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks similar in size, and characteristics that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we pick some points on a relationship to the idea of <unk> doors with straight lines, and this will change the original model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell in the project like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So let's make a scheme that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections for <unk>
And it also responds to local norms in the upper levels, and a lower density in the lower plant.
And I also turn this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving the community to the developing space for construction.
It's where all the neighbors can go up and <unk> and doing such a activities like running a race for two miles a <unk>
These two examples, have a common approach to the design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people change communities and local economies at the same rate that the buildings grow in.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but they need to improve the relationship between the community and the environment and that they have to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had huge amounts of hair, and a small <unk> of <unk> cute was super strong for the capitals of states very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I had my sinister plan.
One day I stayed a while, after the output of the school was a little afternoon, and I hid in the bathroom of the chicks.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took out of my master's table.
And then I did.
<unk> ratings in my <unk> just a little bit, just some of those.
All the ones --  And I set up the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my others had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, no imagination.
I put them all over the <unk> and myself a row of that, just because of being there, because I <unk>
I still think about what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I sat doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never was <unk>
It's that everything was <unk>
I never <unk>
But most of all, I would tell you the reason why I told me that this little little girl was so good at <unk>
I <unk> jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, the primates. The tiles are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of <unk> in the United States.
And yet, I have never seen a study that we would do -- or the <unk> or the sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because the novels are like the laboratory in which we study <unk> in all their different forms.
In fact, I don't know whether it's an exaggeration to say that if there wasn't an exaggeration I would have no literature.
Well, there would have no <unk> <unk> no <unk>
There would be king <unk> no <unk> and a <unk>
There would be Shakespeare.
We would take a high school list in high school, because we would be missing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> no <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without fact, there's no <unk> I know that it's fashion to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and as much as the jealousy, almost everybody has all of them all.
This year you spent a hundred years of your work -- "What is the <unk> time the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> I do, everything we could have --  And thinking about <unk> we have the details, right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot about how hard that image.
We forgot about the <unk> it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said were as tough as <unk>
I don't know how the <unk> <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's look at why they go as well together, the novel and the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the compounds that are reduced to the person, to their desire, to their <unk> are a good narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we get too close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
So when we feel a lot, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about the lives of other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
So being a storytellers and audience, and we know exactly what details <unk> to <unk> the <unk> right?
<unk> do all the <unk> and that is something that I would have understood.
All that she does to give me pleasure to give me pleasure to another, maybe right now.
And it starts to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every single single woman that <unk> detects in his lover, he adds up to his collection of <unk> <unk> in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break it out.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an excitement of it. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the big amounts of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
<unk> came out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links to the language of <unk> with the jealousy.
When you go to the <unk> you're in your <unk> of learning, suddenly listening to the doors and <unk> the <unk> of your lover, then it affects those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know that you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or to look at a <unk>
He says, "These scientific research with real <unk> value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> you see <unk> and they make us seem to be <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for knowledge, a really painful. In fact, what to <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth, better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the <unk>
He says, "A woman who need, that we need to figure out it causes to us a range of feelings of much deepest and vital feelings that a wise man who can <unk>
It's saying we're going to look for <unk> women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> will reveal ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
There's some other excitement to us our <unk> our individual ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at the intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud went to a very <unk> young man who was being consumed with the idea that her woman would <unk>
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man, who didn't be <unk> in what his wife was.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that was doing his wife, without realizing <unk> behavior.
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says that man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> described very well how the <unk> do you look at intensity but without precision.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we become the residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to do violent acts or illegal acts of illegal <unk>
<unk> drives us to behave in totally <unk>
Now I'm thinking about the age of eight years, I mean, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman of Michigan for 52 years of age was captured by having created a false Facebook account.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to go back to the new girlfriend of her former boyfriend, I have to tell you that when or this, I reacted to <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How huge even though <unk> creativity.
It's like <unk>
Like a <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorite ones.
She's a very strange, brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of the <unk> the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want you to do what you have to take in your own and <unk> of what ever ever ever <unk> and it's under the ground, <unk> your <unk> cow bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all over the world, as long as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we are good citizens, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when you're not secure, when you're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think of <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius of it.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which needs to <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius but it is.
Oh, I'm so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once <unk> in <unk> <unk> all with his solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We are <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> who doesn't want to leave your hand.
It's one of the very few times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. It seems to me that that scene is really mysterious, right?
It seems to treat the <unk> as a problem of geometry, no excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute is the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> is allowed to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so hard.
What if the <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a matter of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to combine the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that happens, let's remember that we have fiction to <unk>
Only fiction <unk> jealousy.
<unk> used to <unk> he invites it to the table.
And look at what I'm going to look at the sweet <unk> the scary thing to Tom <unk> the mad <unk> the severe Marcel Marcel <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21st of July models, Buzz <unk> jumped out of the <unk> <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but his presence in the gray surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the biggest flooding in peace times in the history of the United States.
To get to the Moon NASA spent about 180 billion dollars, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave a job to a few 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including Apollo 1.
But before Apollo Apollo <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on its surface, which I stopped after death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical response is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to prove to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the own words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some wonder why <unk>
Why do it make it in our <unk>
And they could also ask, why can climb the most <unk> mountain.
35 years ago, why fly on the <unk>
Why plays Rice versus <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the Moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> Apollo wasn't just a victory of the West over the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger excitement was the <unk> to the transcendence of the technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the Moon happened in a context of a long list of technological narrative.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane, penicillin, and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse or a <unk> ship -- but in 1969, the Apollo crew of Apollo 10 miles a <unk>
Since 1970, any human being has become the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the popular optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that problems that we imagine that technology would be like to go to Mars create a clean energy, heal cancer, or feeding the world population, seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that we didn't go to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I knew that this would be the last mission <unk> but I was totally sure that I would have to see the colonies on Mars.
So that of us came up with our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard that all the time.
We've heard that for the two days here, at TED.
It seems like technologists to us, and they were enriched with trivial, things like <unk> apps and social networks, or algorithms that speed <unk>
There's nothing wrong in most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But not <unk> the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation for <unk> in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have created less ambitious companies that are <unk> to speak, Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, in concrete the incentives that venture capitalists offer the entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the investments of risk caused the creation of <unk> ideas for funding problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mainly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the risk drivers were in their close point without worrying about the risk of the risk -- they preferred <unk> investments that could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble to invest with the benefit in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and development for development -- they don't have invested in developing technologies dedicated to solving big problems because they don't have a proper commercial value.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and deep there.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we <unk>
NASA has actually designed a plan.
But going to Mars would be a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption. It comes out of renewable energy sources like solar power, wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
The coal and natural gas is cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternatives that can race in price.
Now, technologists, and the economists and economists agree about what policies and international treaties development development development development development development -- which is a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control of coal.
But there are no hope in the current political climate that we're going to see an energy policy of America or treaties that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that they look like, technological, it turns out not to be.
We know for the time that vaccines are a result of failure in our food.
But 30 years of research have taught us that death are the political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like the fish or the systems for the storage and working food, but there will be massive governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The phantom president, gave the war to the war to cancer in 1971, we soon found out that there are many types of cancer, some highly resistant to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years seem to have found out effective and viable treatments.
<unk> problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can and we need -- but these four elements have to be <unk> The political leaders and the population must want to want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The mission <unk> which has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve big problems, it leads to those bills.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction as we explore the solar system.
In general, to go to the Moon it turned out to be easy.
I was just three days.
And really, I was not even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Now, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they have become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there have been a huge decrease of trust, is a very generalized statement.
The second one is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should restore trust.
I think <unk> the goal and the task have been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a job, which I think gives a more clear idea about the topic.
First <unk> why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I realize that there may be dropped in some activities or institutions and that might have increased in others.
I don't have that clear.
But I can turn to the surveys of view, and the surveys of opinion are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the surveys of opinion over time, there are no many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, keep <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were really reliable 20 years ago are still a little bit of <unk> <unk>
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half of the way.
But that's enough?
What the surveys of opinion is -- of course, opinions.
What else can you do?
What you see is <unk> attitudes when they do certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in <unk>
Now, if someone got to tell you about <unk>
<unk> in <unk>
<unk> in <unk> <unk>
You probably need to say, "What is what?"
And that would be a very <unk> answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust a some, but in other days.
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to measure the confidence in <unk>
We don't assume that the trust level that we're going to feel for a certain type of <unk> <unk> or type of person, it's going to be uniform in all of the cases.
I could, for example, say that I trust a certain primary school teacher I know to give up the class of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could rely on my wildest friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we stopped all of that knowledge when we think of trust in a more <unk> way.
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the real inherent level of real self-confidence, because they try to <unk> the good inherent judgment in fact to rely on something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the <unk>
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not that the goal that I <unk>
I have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
In fact, I'm a <unk> of not trusting what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who would take their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> that then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> or <unk> or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you tell him, he says, yes, well, that means that what matters in first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What's about to do is to make a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to make a trial, we're obliged to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that a person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we have a very good reason to rely on it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible we couldn't rely on them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that you will take your own <unk>
And I'm happy to say I don't have a lot of friends that I think I don't have a lot of friends and responsible but extremely <unk>
If this is that, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we're going to do is we have to go back before we trust.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to communicate.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've been trying to build <unk> systems for all sorts of professional institutions, and <unk> and so they made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we think that the accountability system is destined to guarantee the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> as we say.
Now you know all of you here are similar examples.
We were looking at everything for the target.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were being worthy of being worthy of trust and <unk> to people who are reliable and if they try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- what it doesn't do properly.
So third of all, the task.
<unk> to the task to reconstruct the trust, puts things on the other way.
It suggests that you and I should reconstruct trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately, it's taboo because we give us a lot of other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have ever given.
You've got to give you the bases enough to be able to rely on you.
You've got to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't get <unk> usually all the people all the time.
But you also have to bring the evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That's done every day everywhere everywhere -- it makes the ordinary people -- the institutions, the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
So the store where I buy my socks says I can <unk> no other way to you.
I carry it up and get me the money, or I change it for the color that I want.
That's great, I rely on them because they become vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson on that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust what you're saying.
So, at the end, I think that what we're looking at is not a very hard thing to <unk>
What people rely on is relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the early computers we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and digital information, <unk> between our material and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been becoming more and more and more and more, at a point that today is less than one containing the glass of a <unk> screen and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have any <unk>
I started to imagine how we <unk>
I first created this tool that goes back into digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers its physical body <unk>
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs below the screen.
So with this tool.
But the two hands stay still out of the screen.
How do you get to the inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of the hands?
In the division of Sciences Sciences of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and converted a small space on the keyboard.
<unk> a transparent bombsight with camera cameras to detect the toes and the face, now you can raise your hands of the keyboard, coming inside of space, and grab pixels directly with hands.
As the windows and the files have a location in the real space, it's just as easy as grab a book from a <unk>
You can move through the book, and you emphasize lines or words with the virtual tactile device that is down there on every floating screen.
The architects can spread or rotate their models directly with hands.
In these examples, we are <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come to us?
<unk> many of us would have bought and back things for the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> for the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry.
If we take this idea further, I thought, rather than just to see pixels in space, how can we make physical things so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would it be a future this?
In the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical eye.
This electromagnet magnet, it behaves like a 3D block in the space, which means that so much the computer as the users can move the object anywhere within this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and controlling the movement by a combination of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And when we program the object, we take away from the constraints of the time and the space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back and stay in the physical world.
You can teach <unk> physically and the famous <unk> of Michael Jordan can play as a physical reality that sometimes we want.
The students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike <unk> or textbooks -- this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's most fascinating about changing the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities going to change.
As you can see, digital information will not only show you something but to begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without that we have to <unk> our world.
So we start the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you take that barrier, the only limit that stays is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1950s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to take you to a school for all expenses <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
And then from surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed firmly that there was only a kind of path to the <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter whether I would like it or not.
But my dream was a Chinese opera singer to be a Chinese opera.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio.
But any adult gave you the idea.
No one adult took me seriously.
Only my friends <unk> but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew that it was too much bigger to train.
My dream never got <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class is the only thing that I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one to me, I wanted to do it. Okay.
I would go to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books to here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> about Chinese <unk>
And it's not propaganda <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said to me, "It's so different and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the relationship with my parents.
And I meet with a new culture also led to my habit of reading <unk>
<unk> many perspectives.
For example, at the beginning of this map, I found myself out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I never had happened that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> is not a new thing.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to fields of research as a comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> give the academics a deeper understanding of a topic.
And I thought that if reading comparative reading would work for researching, why don't we do it in <unk> life.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> by David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's a fun fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Instead of <unk> in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
So for example, it's through the translation that I realized that I was in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk>
The books opened up a magical door to connect with people in the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to be feeling <unk>
Having a dream -- it really is nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that the breakthrough is not the only purpose of a dream.
Its most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams of where the passion comes from, where the passion comes from.
Even a dream -- it can do that for you.
And because of the books, I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a <unk> student in psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex walked up to the first session, using jeans and a <unk> threw out on the couch, of my office <unk> the shoes and told me I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My colleague colleague had a <unk> as a first client.
And I got a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> he made me easy to just move your head while we would get the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> and so I watched she was correct.
You start to work later, you go home later, you have children later, until death comes next.
For <unk> as Alex and I had a time of <unk>
But shortly after, my <unk> pushed me to Alex to Alex that I would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Sure, he's coming out with guys underneath her category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like being married with it."
And then my <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe you have the next.
In addition, the best time to work at the marriage, of Alex is before it <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk>
It was when I realized that the <unk> aren't the new <unk>
Yes, people sit down after what they would do, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex in the development.
This did that the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment, and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem, not only to Alex and his love life but for race careers, the families and the future of the <unk>
There's 50 million <unk> in America, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think no one comes to the age -- not going to go before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove the dream -- I want to see. It's good, <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the keys in life will go to 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 choices and experiences and moments <unk> who give his life to have been in order to be 30 and <unk>
People over 40, I didn't go to panic.
This audience will be right, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we want.
We know that more than half of the Americans are married, or they're coming out with their future future at 30 years.
We know that the brain is coming up to the second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something that you want to change yourself.
We know that the personality.
<unk> are the moment for <unk> about their body and their choices.
When we think about development development, we all know that the first five years are critical for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which his everyday life and common has an impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in human development.
But this is not what the people are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of the <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a <unk> adolescence <unk>
<unk> <unk> names of <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines <unk>
And he was saying that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think when you give you a <unk> in your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
It's nothing.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing happens.
And then all the days -- smart <unk> like you or your children and girls come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is good for me, but this relationship doesn't own. It's just killing time."
Or they say, "All they say as a career before the 30, everything is good."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My dating dates during the <unk> were like the computer game.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point about the 30, it turned out the music and everybody started sitting.
I didn't want to be the only one who would stay stop, so I sometimes think I was married to my husband because he was the closest chair when I was <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit wrong, but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure to the <unk> and so many of you start a career, to choose a city -- and have two or three children in a long period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that start to show you, which is much more difficult and stressful to do all of one time to <unk>
The middle of the middle age -- it's not about buying it to buy red.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want to do now.
You notice that you can't have the son you want to do now, or you can't give you a brother to your child.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I'm talking about the room, and you talk about their <unk> "What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
The 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having a women's crisis.
He said that I'd like to work in art or entertainment, but I still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend that showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a few very tough <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then she gets to her as to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can pick your friends."
Well, a day Emma got her head on his legs and cried for nearly the time.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and it had spent all the morning <unk> with her many <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that continues after the words of <unk> please <unk> <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he watched me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care if I give you <unk>
At that point, I took it a lot to resist and I didn't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really was <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew that this was her chance.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as for just sit while the <unk> Emma would happen.
So, for the next few weeks, and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or a woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma who was <unk> from that identity of identity and <unk> of identity.
For identity capital, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
To do something that you want to be after.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and no one knows the future of the work, but I know about it: identity of identity <unk>
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company that you want to try to.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that I should not tell you, by the way, it's not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that would explore jobs and to do it.
Secondly, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to get you at the airport, but the <unk> who get together with friends with the minds of the similar minds as well as you know what you know about, how you do, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person coming out -- almost always come out of its closest circle.
new things come from what they're called weak ties friends from friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job, or they don't have work.
But the other half no, and the weak links are the shape of <unk> to this group.
Half the middle of the <unk> has never been <unk> then, to meet the boss of your neighbor is the way we get a job to not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last one, but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but to your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma would soon go to her family, when I have a partner and it would have a <unk>
I told Emma that time to pick her family out there were come.
Maybe you think about 30 is better enough to sit on head that 20 or even 25 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to pick the person that you live now or you're going to tell you now when all of the Facebook start to walk towards the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you do it, and that means being as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just to do to do it will work or kill time with anyone who would be <unk>
So what happened with <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate in a cousin of a cousin who was working on a art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a work there.
That labor supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend with his living lives.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married with a man who chose consciously <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves her new family and send me a letter that I said, "Now the spaces of emergency guard aren't enough enough.
The story of Emma can sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like airplane who come out of the Los Angeles, who go somewhere in the West.
Right before the <unk> a slight match in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21 or 25 and even <unk> a good conversation a good time, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years, or even in the following generation.
Here is my idea worthy of spread all the <unk> you know.
It's as simple as I learned to tell you <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege to tell you about Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> -- and get the identity of identity -- use their weak creatures, choose your family.
They don't stop to define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in management management for a work that was even more <unk>
I was to show you math mathematics at <unk> New York City.
And as any teacher, I applied tests and testing.
I do homework.
When the work came back, you were grades.
What I called me the attention was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the ones who had a better performance of <unk> <unk>
Some of my most smart kids wasn't going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing that you need to learn in math in seventh grade, surely, they're <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during the time.
After several years more of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of the students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know about how to measure more <unk>
It's the <unk> but what happens if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and <unk>
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the West <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training and who is <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children were doing, the further possible in the competition.
We study teachers -- working in neighborhoods, <unk> what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective at improving the learning outcomes of their <unk>
We associate with private companies, asking us what of these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all of these very different contexts emerged a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, human health, and it wasn't <unk>
It was the <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have <unk>
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
The determination is to live life as if it was a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my questionnaires questionnaires and then waited about over a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly better than <unk> even though <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income -- the results of <unk> tests, even the security that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or in the National <unk> of <unk> where the <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is the little thing that we know, the science about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we development for children?
What should I do to teach the kids a robust <unk>
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you.
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of gifted individuals who simply don't go forward with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination often is not related to whether or is even related to the productivity of talents.
So far the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in children is something called <unk> of <unk>
This is an idea at the University of Stanford for <unk> <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth of growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start all of new with the <unk> lessons to start all again.
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children be more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most passionate memories is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I would be inspired by this incredible language.
But for a foreign training, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been asking if I can bring down this <unk> so that the one that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language I can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw every one of the strokes of every character in the right slide.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than let's do it in a faster and simple way.
An Chinese scholar <unk> 20 thousand characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic quality.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read traffic signals from <unk> to understand the basic idea of the web pages.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open his mouth as much as possible until it's <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person in both sides, as if I were shouting at a <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the form of <unk> but I like to believe that it is in the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The <unk> symbol looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old West.
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
It's building blocks so they do a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old man, two are a company, three are a <unk>
If one person stretches up your arms, this person is saying <unk>
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> in the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a single tree is a pretty idiot.
Do you remember <unk>
Two minutes together, it becomes very hot.
Three ways together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the yellow moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun is coming on the horizon.
A door. Put a table inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played someone in home?
This person is coming out there hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three thousand women together, have care is <unk>
So we've been for almost 30 characters.
By using this method -- the first eight radical <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build other 32.
So with every small effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing that you learn a Chinese <unk>
So after the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun put on the beginning, because Japan is to the east of China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in <unk> because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the <unk> has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a way.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad are the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film was his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand, and I'll take a magic wand, it.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand it's extraordinary.
Now we live and raising our children in a kind of industrial complex <unk>
However, the magician of Oz was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal kid and a <unk> <unk> <unk> to a girl wearing a <unk>
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a huge difference between these two movies, there are a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the investments of Oz is doing today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
We would have magical shoes to defeat the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
The only one of the <unk> of the magician of Oz is that the most amazing characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to see this when I did to see Star Wars a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that moment, I also had a son at all.
Only three years.
It wasn't invited by the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight there were <unk>  So the meantime, in the room, and I was impressed in the room, and I didn't think he understood what was going on, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what to say?
They would be helpful issues and <unk>
It would have the feeling that Luke one of an army to remove the government?
<unk> this with the magician.
How does Dorothy his movie?
We're going to do good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world in which I want my children to grow <unk> OK? And not a world of men that <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much of the capital capital F, strength in the films for our children, and so little on the road <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of the movies of male violence in girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that the Princess <unk> doesn't provide the right framework that I would have served to navigate the world of the adults, which is <unk>  I think at the point of the first joke, I really hoped that <unk> started to appear because it's the end of the film, right?
My search has finished, I have <unk>
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are a lot of exceptions, and defend the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the children, although them, the guys, aren't really their objective public.
They do a phenomenal job to teach girls how to protect them against <unk> but they don't necessarily show the kids how to protect the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have a few great women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful topic of all of the days continues to come up in classical after classic each of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are raising a child.
And so as many of you are thinking, this year, I finally came out <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in shops.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came out <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't leave that <unk>
Well, almost no one of these films is the proof of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not the roots and already <unk> but perhaps today we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is an comics, and in the <unk> of the 1980s, I recorded a conversation that I had with a friend about the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple -- there are only three questions that you need to <unk> in the film, there's more than a female character who has lines?
So, you have to do the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something beyond the guy who <unk>      Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I really rarely see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality of very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- an idea of consensus what a quality of Hollywood Hollywood is.
<unk> doesn't happen the proof of <unk>
And I don't think that I think about it because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen a lot of the movie in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes that have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the big moment for one of the <unk> to take a look at the door, and say, <unk> the bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's take it into the numbers.
In 2011, of the most popular movies, how many of them believe they have <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there is a larger number that this is going to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he would say?
In the United States, one of five women says it's been sexually assaulted once in his life.
I don't think it's the <unk>
I don't think the movies for kids have something to do with that.
Nor do I think that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but it's wrong, and when I hear that statistics -- one of the things I think is there's a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are you <unk>
What do you do?
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then making the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our disposal as <unk> <unk> and we hope that that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to their parents.
I think we need to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of <unk> is radically changing.
You've read about how new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite character was like, <unk> <unk> Do you know what you want.
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common these <unk>
Maybe it's not just the brilliant <unk>
I think they're an expert.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anybody, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to try to get their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories where I tell my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where you see that your work is join a team, maybe a team led for women, help other people improve and will be better people, like the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine and one of the things that I was most liked was to look for <unk> cookies in the coast of Maine because my parents told me that I would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered with sand and it's hard to see it.
However, over time, I would go to <unk>
I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started to study <unk> I realized I would see with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach, in Maine had grown up to one of almost 1.3 miles of length.
And my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite pictures.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see in another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see the infrared be?
This is a located place in the Eastern Valley of Egypt called <unk>
And the place in the naked eye, it seems to be brown but when we use infrared colors, suddenly the place looks like <unk> bright.
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes of the landscape caused by the materials materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we have used satellite data to find a <unk> old city called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Ottoman about about 4,000 years ago.
The place in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire, there was this great revival of ancient art, architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk>
This area is huge measures about <unk> per <unk> miles.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to the side of <unk> and as changed with time, I moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk>
And I'll try to find out the random equivalent to look for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA data to make a map of the place, with very subtle change.
We were able to see where we would get the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area slightly high that you see inside the circle here, that we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> <unk> you can see it here.
When I say <unk> is like the shots of the ice, but instead of the layer of climate change, we look for <unk> of human occupation as well.
Five meters down, underneath a thick layer of <unk> we find a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years that date from the Ottoman Ottoman exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also find <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> which proves that there was a shop of <unk>
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think of the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Ottoman Ottoman these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that back in the Ottoman Empire.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry shop that proves that what's been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but we would take a place in a near future to <unk>
And more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Ottoman River -- probably was written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to TED, TED wasn't founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do you know that ideas happen in 1984 sequenced C in a lost city not for a long time and found from high.
It certainly puts the Google <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk> home.
I would like you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that he's done.
Now <unk> a group of <unk> <unk>
They are competing in a <unk> race and go in direction to their front door.
I need to look at this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> a lot.
And they collide against the door of his home.
There are bicycles flying around the place, wheels that go on to their side, rays from the wheels that end up in <unk> <unk> the threshold of the door,
The lobby, to the hall or what is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light, the light is shining on the <unk> of <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
So from his chair, on a brown horse bag.
It's a horse that talks about.
You can feel your blue <unk> the <unk> on your nose.
You can sniff out <unk> and you can get it to be on the mouth.
You can go on one side and go to your living room.
It's already in the room in the room, and doing much of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing about her <unk> <unk> singing <unk> A <unk> A <unk>
Now we go to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a path of yellow <unk> and from the oven, they come up to you <unk> <unk> <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open the eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest that is running every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist <unk> waiting, I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers of numbers -- look at them once.
<unk> the names of tens and tens of strangers.
We were all in just a few minutes.
<unk> to see who I could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be phenomena.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man called Ed <unk> who had come from England, and he has a better <unk>
I asked him, <unk> when realized that you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I'm not a psychologist.
I actually have a average memory.
All of those who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
We have been trained to do these miracle acts of memory acts of memory of memory -- the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their <unk> and the medieval academics used to memorize books to <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How do you have heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the hall of competition, and <unk> who is an amazing English and brilliant English guy, although a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You meet <unk> <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
"Because I would like to teach <unk> <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of <unk> in <unk>
That would show you the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not <unk> <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something <unk>
And that was the beginning of a very weird journey for me.
And I ended up happening most of the year -- not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> is awesome.
Someone would be incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see what our memory we are.
In the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent one afternoon in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> guides <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, you have a number of treaties on the writing memory something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having memory <unk> disciplined and <unk> wasn't a very rare thing as it can look like today.
A long time ago, people will invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but we also have changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would say that they have changed our cognitive practice.
And as we already don't have to remember, sometimes it seems to have us forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate people about this idea of a <unk> memory memory and <unk> is this competition as singular of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are <unk> like this everywhere in the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do these people.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at University College London invited a group of memory memory, to the laboratory.
They wanted to know: be that it has brains in some form of structural way, or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're more smart than the <unk>
They gave them a computer <unk> and the answer was actually no.
There were a really interesting difference and significant difference between the brains of memory memory and the control subjects with the <unk>
When they put them on a <unk> MRI MRI machine, which is their brains while <unk> numbers, and forms of <unk> they found that in the memory memory of the brain, different parts of the brain, different to others.
In fact, they <unk> or looked at <unk> a part of the brain that involves space and navigation.
Why? There's something that we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> competitive people are running as an armed race in where every year shows somebody with a new way to remember more things, and then the rest of competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory memory.
In his desk in front of him, there are 36 <unk> <unk> which he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and that just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk>
<unk> Yeah.
And as there is a huge amount of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used to end the end of a concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with an elegant paradox known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> says the following: I say to two people who remember the same word -- I'm telling you that there's a man called <unk>
That's her <unk>
And then I'm asking you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I asked them to tell you that word I told you a <unk>
What is <unk>
The person who told her name is Baker is a little likely to remember the same word that the person who told her work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity to <unk> that is weird.
What about here?
Well, the name's Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship.
All the other memories that were dancing for his head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They wear <unk>
They have <unk>
They are okay when they go home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when I took that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point again.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this brings two years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who went to a <unk>
They had hired as a entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't get to a <unk> <unk>
He stood up with his memory poem, and he <unk> and so soon it was, the <unk> <unk>
<unk> all of us.
But not only did it killed everybody, but it holds the bodies <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were at.
So they couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only <unk> in the bottom of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting on every hand.
I took the family of the hand <unk> where their loved ones between the rubble.
What I would do, <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we are not good to remember names or <unk> or instructions on the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and exceptional space and spatial space and spatial space and spatial spatial space for a word.
If I told you that I would tell you the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to do it.
But I would bet if you asked them to tell you who I was sitting on the horse <unk> in your lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory of memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a council that comes from more than 2,000 years ago to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to do that memory -- in the same way that I would have done it -- if you were invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're in the door of your house.
And it came up with some kind of image absolutely ridiculous ridiculous and crazy to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that <unk>
And then you can imagine coming back to your house and see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see <unk> <unk> to remind that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then it falls into the kitchen, and the fourth topic that they would talk about would be that weird journey that they did for a whole year and have some friends to help remember it.
This is how the speakers <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not a word for the word, which is going to confuse but typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
It's an <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and at the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got on to it on it.
I went to some of these skills of memory and I had the idea of writing something much about this <unk> of <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
seriously, it's like seeing a bunch of people sitting taking exams. I mean, that the most exciting thing that happens is when someone got <unk>
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I don't have access access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I found that this was entertaining.
I would never have expected it to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it's actually about doing is better improving the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images -- <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was pretty excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for the memory competition.
This is a couple of <unk> and some of the electronic security glasses -- leaving just two <unk> because the distraction.
I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could <unk> in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve a good deal for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's cute to be able to memorize <unk> and numbers on the phone, but actually this is not the point.
These are just so <unk> <unk> that work.
Because they're based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to get to build <unk> from memory or memorize <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply.
The palace of <unk> these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make it happen.
<unk> a kind of deep processing processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of the majority are not <unk> by there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things are doing <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what I would do, the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left myself to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is our <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks up to our side to be so <unk> that we don't even <unk> in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are amazing memory capacities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person that remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover 18 minutes.
It's a complex subject, so we would take only a place to <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am in the fact that I was a <unk> and I lived there in home from my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that I would share with my sister.
And between my <unk> and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there were all the time looking at television -- so every time I would go from my room to the bathroom, everybody sat down and I would go back in a <unk> all of me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> safe and hated it.
<unk> that <unk> I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that home.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture -- because architecture is not about <unk> not <unk> or <unk> connections that we feel in the places that we want.
And it doesn't wonder that we feel like that way, because according to the Climate Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time underground.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines us in ways we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you want to do, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that we think about it in a building building two years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> who use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long time ago.
We used 200 years ago to build <unk>
We use it in the 19th century to build art.
And in the United century in America, we use it to build home.
See, these <unk> stable <unk> in front of the <unk>
This is very, very useful, because building things is frightening.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has a <unk> has this round of <unk> columns, red brick that are <unk> which is about communicating with this <unk> the children, the values, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, he ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, reading and sharing.
So what is possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that are constantly driving new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for current life forms.
We made them and we made it completely away from the people.
And all of the black -- this is we <unk> you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have another choice.
We have to go on the other side and go back to these symbols <unk>
So we do, and we are all happy, but we are all happy, but we just feel like <unk> So we started experimenting with <unk> we do that back and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago I was <unk> from the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It's got to do with concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small, on a <unk> scale.
Something really hard.
So we approaching the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the <unk> again in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that like and the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added a bake new materials.
I love it.
We don't take <unk>
We take <unk> and we convert it into a skyscraper that can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes <unk> <unk> on audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
A madness.
But they were the 1980s, that was awesome.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be the <unk> to the French, or to the Italian.
You can even have a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because rather than creating new spaces, we have memories of other places.
I know very well, and everybody knows, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects are frustrated and we started to swing the <unk> again in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols we have -- we have now with new, new design techniques -- and we find out with new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other forms.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You have totally <unk>
Normally the <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those weird moments when academic and public <unk> in general, were fully realizing about a building.
New York Times <unk> this building of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao goes up in a 2,500 percent when they finished the building.
So suddenly, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle Chicago, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everyone wanted one, and Frank was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild ways, and how it is possible to become ubiquitous across the world?
And it happened, because the media <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those shapes meant and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing made the main mayors in the world.
So everybody thought that if they had these shapes, they had a culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the new performance happened with other star.
It went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, it actually started going to happen with all architecture.
Think about that, for example, how use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to have walked up to the next village to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in newspapers, on TV, and at the end, all of us are photographers of architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now, that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because the architecture is moving so quickly.
It's not very accurate to think about a building.
It takes a long time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight or 100 more buildings, before we know if I was designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we meet buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That will never happen to happen, because we are at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the <unk> of the steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the media, of communication, it starts to swing faster and faster until being on both of the surface of the <unk> and <unk> actually the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you know, the public.
Now we can make symbols of almost <unk> with emotional load.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, it was already part of the community, and like drawings seemed exactly the way to the product finished, no surprises.
The building came out to be part of the community, that first summer, when people started to get and share it in social media, the building left in the social media, the building stopped being a means of communication, because these are not only images of a building, and it's the images that one made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes it <unk> with collective memory and to charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell us each other what we think of architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first <unk> to the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> innovation, which can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell you that there are no unique response to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are already not these mysterious creatures who use <unk> words and drawings -- and one is no longer an <unk> public that doesn't accepts something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen to and you don't leave it for architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of a style to another, from a movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go forward and find appropriate solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historic <unk> of red brick with the basis of what it should be a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we ultimately are ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings <unk> the <unk> of nature, and not the opposite.
This means that a garage garage, in Miami world: Florida, also it can serve to do a sports or for <unk> or even one can get married there at the night.
This means that three architects can dream on the East East New York City in New York City, and raising half a half million dollars of the community surrounding around that cause, it's no longer a customer alone.
It means that any building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we think is what we build.
The architects already know how to make buildings more <unk> smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give them way to the most <unk> spaces local libraries -- the homes where we formed our children, and the <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
He just turned a year and started walking.
And it makes it so great, typical of the children in a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do at the moment is look at the mirror.
She really loves her reflection.
<unk> and <unk> and it gives himself those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And it's all of your friends doing this and my mom tells me I used to do it. When couple of doing this?
How is we suddenly not taste with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people seek to Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, you just want to be loved and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit confused -- it's a little confused because, despite her mom telling him all the time he is beautiful, every day in school, somebody says it's ugly.
Amongst what his mom tells you and what your friends, or colleagues in school say, doesn't know who believe.
So a video of her itself, he publishes it on YouTube, and begs others to please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received over 13,000 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> that you don't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal healthy and normal <unk> who gets these answers in one of their most vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are swimming videos like this, in their most teenage girls trying to communicate in this way.
But what is it doing this?
Well, the teenagers today almost never are alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, speaking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Never before we have been so connected, in a continuous way, so <unk>
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
There is just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment of being always connected -- it's <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There are no division between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what it is what is <unk>
What is the most prominent thing in the life of someone in front of which it's normal in a stable context.
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> of girls right now.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see why you compare the young ones.
But kids aren't immune to this.
Like the inner stars of the sport, and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be individuals that are <unk>
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to dedicate more time and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, developing their physical capacity, their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six of every 10 girls would rather not do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk>
It's important activities for its growth as human beings and as a taxpayers and the field of development development.
<unk> percent, almost one of three teenage teenagers are not interested in <unk> <unk> to participate in the classroom, because they don't want to call attention for their physical stuff.
One of every five aren't attending classes at all the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season tests, if you don't believe you look good enough, specifically if you don't believe you're doing good enough -- you know, a lower note to the average of your fellow who don't care about that appearance.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland in America and China, in China.
And it gives regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, to be well of course, we're talking to you as you see you, not what you're really like.
The low self-esteem on its body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The adolescents with a little bit less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, participate in more diet doesn't healthy that they can take them into a food <unk>
They have low self-worth.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and are at greater risk of depression.
And we think that's all about what they make more <unk> choices like the alcohol of alcohol and drugs, diets.
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they're overweight again, irrespective of whether or don't have greater rates of <unk>
The 17 percent of women don't present to a work interview in a day where they don't feel safe in the way you see it.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would be that <unk>
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, for itself, doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways -- the first one is that we have to instill trust in their own body.
We need to help our teens develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-worth.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very impressed by when I learned that a lot of programs <unk> no longer realizing the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six keys. The first is the influence of family, friends and relations.
These six aspects are important points for anyone willing to provide a education in the body self-esteem to work.
A education is <unk> but dealing with this problem requires every one of us that take the shelves in the issue and let's be a better model to continue for women and girls in our own lives.
challenge the current status of like women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of the Olympic athlete is actually dependent on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people for what they are, not as you see.
All of us can begin to take responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can tell people based on their effort and their actions and not in its appearance.
And let me ask you -- "When was the last time you would get a <unk>
In short, we need to work together as communities, as governments and as companies and as companies, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow up to the whole person to be able to be valuing the <unk> diversity, the <unk>
We have to put people to really make the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make a difference in the great screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never <unk> of being who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean.
Who are in your mind.
They <unk>
They <unk>
They <unk>
Her <unk>
It could just be the woman who is two car seats, what it would mean for her if it was liberated from that <unk> voice in his interior, which I would pay for you by not having a long legs -- <unk> <unk> a smaller <unk>
What would it mean for her if we would take this and say that it would give their potential to that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is <unk>
But let's take our children to the truth.
<unk> that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
We would go to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about, and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, they become agents of real things in the same morning.
Let's do it.
September November in 1990 -- a gentleman called <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the <unk> <unk> <unk> the leader of the World Department of Defense <unk>
At <unk> initially he was innocent, but being killed by other charges in the company of others started planning attacks attacks in New York <unk> including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Luckily, those plans would be challenged by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't be able to avoid.
He later <unk> it would be sentenced to their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my dad.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer <unk> with a <unk> American mother, Harvard from the two made all the possible for me to give me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, which very few, even most of the Muslims, get to know.
For experience I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to want the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, in all of the human group, there's always a small fraction of people who are so <unk> to their convictions that think that we need to use all the possible media so that everybody lived like them.
A few months before he arrest him, he sat up with me and explained that in the last weekends of week, he and some friends had been going to <unk> training in Long Island, to practice practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We arrived at the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I touched my father <unk> my father helped me support the <unk> in the shoulder, and explained how to aim about about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet I shot her little orange light on the goal, and to surprise all, particularly of me, all the goal broke on flames.
My uncle turned to the other and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
From such a parent, as a child.
All of all, the comment made a lot of laughter. But only a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see me at me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be <unk> by putting a run with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground park of the north Trade Trade Trade Trade Center -- causing a explosion that killed six people and <unk> other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called it <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved away 20 times that instability during my childhood, I didn't allow me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to someone already to pack and go to another city.
As I was always my new face of the kind of <unk> <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the <unk> but to be the new of the class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons not developed social skills, to put it out of <unk> <unk> -- it wasn't prepared for the real world.
I <unk> Opera opera, judge people with based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that I put proof to test my way to think was during the presidential presidential elections.
In a <unk> program where I met in the National Convention <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence as I had been a victim of <unk> almost my life, was something that I felt very much passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who had done friendship, was Jewish was Jewish up.
I took a number of days to go out to light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> among the two.
I never had a Jewish friend and frankly I sat very proud of being able to beat the barrier that every life had been done to me that I was <unk>
Another critical moment came up when I got a summer work on Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I found myself with people of all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was critical in development of my character.
Every life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all gay were bad <unk>
I had a chance to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the saddest and less critical that I had seen in life.
Having been a child, I developed a sense of empathy towards the suffering of others. But it wasn't easy to me to treat people kind, exactly how I would have to be treated.
By that feeling I was able to imagine the stereotypes that had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction.
I don't know what that is to be homosexual but I know what is being <unk> for something beyond my control.
And then the <unk> <unk>
Every day, Jon Stewart asked me to be honest with me to be honest about my <unk> and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, don't have anything to do with the character.
In many ways he became my figure at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes inspiration can come out of the unexpected. And a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think and she told me something that <unk> in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the tired eyes of somebody who has suffered enough with no <unk> <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a possible <unk>
Well, it's easy.
I've done that because I hope you someone, one day who is trying to take the violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way to me that even though I gave this ideology violent ideology and <unk> I didn't come to me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it for the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, and the loss that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism talking, against those <unk> acts as denial to the actions of my dad.
So with this very simple one, here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this point there is a film that projects in your minds.
It's an incredible film.
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has color, taste and texture.
feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood you project to your eyes.
And it's constantly a <unk> voice, in your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie are you who experience it all right.
This film is your flow of conscience, the subject of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie, tea, you and you.
There's nothing to make it more directly.
At least I know I have an consciousness.
I don't have certainty that you are aware.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of anything in our lives I would have sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why aren't we just robots that we have to make results without experiencing the <unk> film.
At this point, no one knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible to a science of consciousness.
And science, for nature, is an objective one.
<unk> for nature, is beauty.
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because during almost all of the 20th century, we would look at that vision.
Now, psychology was studying <unk> behavior, neuroscience brain -- but no one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few scientists about consciousness.
It was about 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science to <unk>
And since then, there was a real <unk> a <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has the fundamental constraints to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand a lot better, for example, the brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling happy to feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a behavioral science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain to you that this kind of neuroscience work answering some questions that we want to explain to consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain and what would be <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy issues.
without offend the <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real central mystery of this <unk> why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal <unk>
At this point, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to convert it into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find <unk>
The classic <unk> are all of these emerging behaviors -- how they operate the <unk> how they work <unk> and <unk> living organisms -- all of these are questions about how it works.
That might be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as we <unk> how we speak, how we speak, how we do, how we speak, are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question why it's all accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here is the standard standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, in fact, still doesn't have a lot to say.
I am a <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that will work. For a long time, I would put my head on the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms that would work.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we were going to go on this point.
We have a chain of fundamental explanations -- we have been used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are aware.
For another, we don't know how to bring that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think awareness right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our view of the world, but we don't know we still how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning <unk> crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, he's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there's no such hard problem of consciousness.
And all the idea of the subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain the <unk> functions -- the behaviors of the brain, and then you study everything that needs <unk>
Well, more power for him.
So that's the radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of pure consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many other people, that vision is pretty close to simply denying the observation of consciousness.
But I am in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe as a basic building blocks space, the time and the mass.
<unk> laws that <unk> like laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and properties are not going to explain in terms of any more basic thing.
On the contrary, it becomes fundamental, and there are the world.
Sometimes, the list of the core is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, <unk> laws of Newton. So I applied the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electric burden that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain awareness in terms of fundamental ideas, space ideas, <unk> then for a matter of logic, you have a list of it.
The most natural thing would be <unk> the same as a primal <unk> a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern awareness, the laws that connect awareness to other fundamental ideas, the space, the <unk> physical processes.
<unk> sometimes say that we want the fundamental laws that we can put them in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find the fundamental laws that we can <unk> in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're after.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious -- not only humans, the dogs, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons will be smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of anguish when you think I'm always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that the photons can have some element of crude feeling -- <unk> some early precursor to consciousness.
This might sound a little crazy for you.
How does someone think about something so <unk>
In part this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is critical.
If it's primal as the space, the time and the mass, is naturally to pretend that it can be universal, like others.
It's also worth note that even though the idea seems to us, which is much less for human cultures, where the human mind seems more continuous with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way of finding critical laws that we understand thinking with the physical process, is <unk> awareness with information.
Whenever there's information processing information, there is consciousness.
<unk> <unk> complex, like in a human being, a complex consciousness.
<unk> of simple data, simple consciousness.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration, which calls <unk> which measures the degree of information in a system.
And I'm supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an amazing degree of integration, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a half a <unk> of information integration, as a pretty significant, degree of consciousness.
But when you get to the <unk> microbes, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of <unk>
It made a core law of <unk> high school of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate awareness to the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk to us about the reality that underlies the below.
As explains Stephen <unk> "Where is the <unk>
From <unk> vision -- the equations of physics can leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically described the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire on the equations.
In that vision, consciousness doesn't find out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's there in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical consequences quite serious.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I wasn't supposed to eat anything that I had to do, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get a lot of hunger.
I think about it well, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms, and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of conscience, but its importance and its complexity.
It's also natural to ask awareness in other systems, like computers.
What's about the artificial intelligence system in Samantha in the <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the view of <unk> information, she has a complicated processing processing processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have a pretty serious ethical problems about the development of developing systems systems and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask the awareness of collective collective <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience at a TED talk, an internal <unk> for this whole whole group of TED, different from the inner movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question you should be serious.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more sure of the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex conscience, we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go on the right way to a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, this is probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it at night at the morning.
But I think we finally go to find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the wrong idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
I had a very normal profile, an underwater part of education.
I went to school, I took myself with my friends, I would get myself with my oldest sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to make it for a prize for the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very beautiful, but there is a problem.
She hasn't gotten anything."  And they were correct.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had an underwater profile in my mother, and I spent a long time by looking at the <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were correct.
I did nothing to be extraordinary at all.
Nothing to be an achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, being in the second part of teaching at a high school school in a high school school -- just after about 20 minutes in the class 11, <unk> a boy raised her hand and said, "Hey, when give you your <unk>
And I said, "What do you say?
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a few good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> <unk>
When people in chairs in the wheels, they talk about things -- at school?"
Usually in the <unk> room.
And it was then when I realized, this boy had experienced experiences with disabled people as objects of inspiration.
And we don't know it. And it's not about the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers, or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We are there for <unk>
And in fact, I'm on this stage -- I think that I do in this wheelchair, and probably you're waiting for you to <unk> Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid.
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you were lied to the disability.
Yes, they have sold the lie that disability is a little <unk> A <unk>
It's a bad thing to live with a disability that makes you <unk>
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make you a <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
It's possible that you've seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl with no hands on a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these images that are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the term porn <unk> because we took a group of people to benefit from another group of people.
So in this case, we would take the disabled in the benefit of people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and say, "Well, for very bad than my life, could be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times that I've been doing strange <unk> expressing that you believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this would happen before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I got to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images, those images are going to be careful people in the benefit of people with no disability.
They're there so you can look at them and think that things are not as bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a real person is actually a hard.
So let's make some things.
But the things that we stay in aren't the things that you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> I would deliberately end up because I was called in the call social model that tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live through our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
And the things I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of their capacity as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those photos as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common thing.
They're simply using their bodies taking the best of their capacity.
So it's really fair to <unk> in the way we do, to share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you as a compliment.
And I know why happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have been sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honest does it don't.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "Oh God, you're not going to be inspired by something inspired by something.
And I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
I don't think I am lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a cool idea to use <unk> <unk> to collect the things that you fall over --  -- <unk> the ingenious trick of how to put the battery out of the mobile phone in the <unk>
Great.
We learn from the strength and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really think that lie that have been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because of the social model of disability.
A lot of <unk> to a <unk> stretch has never done it to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> before a television screen will not go to the <unk> for <unk>
Nor do a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a little girl at 15 years, sitting in his <unk> watching the <unk> <unk> don't be seen by being in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people who are <unk> by getting out of bed and remember our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of religious people and I want to live in a world where a child of the 11 degree in a high school school, is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> user <unk>
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but questioning what you think to know about what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality and the professional football with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'll just respond to one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think about <unk> you think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that happens in our days and to happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to learn, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to the <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing with the Google Google <unk>
I'm sure many are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
They allow them to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a frame that you would do with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and knowing what is running through the field of play to 160 <unk> the blood <unk>
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds <unk> we will <unk> trying to <unk> all its self.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
<unk> some videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the shell, and give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not pictures of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the startup technology of startup technology is a submarine going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrific to be <unk>
So a moment -- I have a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in the field of the <unk>
You may have realized that people have the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, be their favorite players and asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
Or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how we get to <unk> how we took it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely many of you know about.
<unk> Rift has been described as the most realistic device ever created, and it's not cheap. cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, why, with this video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
<unk> This is the experience of a man in a rollercoaster in a rollercoaster <unk> for his life.
So what will be the experience of a fan when I <unk> a movie of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before I run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> throwing the ball into the bottom of the network?
What will be their experience when we get a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour.
Maybe it's going to be thrown out of <unk> <unk>
But this is not still <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to <unk> <unk>
<unk> the ultimate reality when they sell them, and the owners look at the information of what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to gain. It gives you money.
So, here's a brief refresher on technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore put a <unk> to his field <unk> so that he would play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radii in the <unk> of the field and then after the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player going back to his group and see his next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that carry on on it. You don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
Or you know, the strategy.
Just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches do it, because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose <unk> and they hate to lose games.
If you lose parties as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game.
How would you do?
Well, a very simple option would be having a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people that are down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and the <unk> something that you're already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will have <unk>
The bad ones have <unk> information.
This is going to make good teams of the bad.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to stop it to <unk>
It's also going to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the camp.
Imagine that it's the field <unk>
We put the ball and <unk>
<unk> to a open receptor -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of the left of your Norden bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> <unk> not <unk> but the <unk> system is <unk>
It would be the area of protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you know, there's a open receptor down.
<unk> the <unk> but they <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land -- yet the receptor sees its bombsight -- an area of grass that goes up, and you can modify the race.
It's <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and fans have followed it from every angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to make a lot of people -- because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the camp.
They want to be their favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports, because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of <unk>
We're going to use it only as bread and <unk> like our entertainment <unk>
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to encourage the empathy between human beings, to show someone what it is, literally, being in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of revenues a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how <unk> are their actions from <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia, trying to show the world how it is being <unk>
How much is it for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science rather and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality comes close.
The questions that we do, the choices we do and the challenges that we face, <unk> like all of us.
Thank you.
Recently I took me up after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
The majority of those 23 years ago I spent the south of the <unk> County that includes the Golden Gate Bridge <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure known to its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for flight, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> an chief chief engineer to build the bridge, said that the bridge is essentially <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical or practical or <unk>
But from its openness, over 1600 people have jumped on their death from that bridge.
Some of them believe that traveling between the two towers will take you to another dimension, this bridge has <unk> as opposed to each of you from taking you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
And then after a free of four to five seconds, the body spreads against water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks down the bones, some of which we have vital organs.
Most people die in the impact.
The ones that don't usually get in the water water, and then they <unk>
I don't think the ones that we put this <unk> method of suicide realizing that it will be <unk>
This is why.
Except, about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
Here is where most people have to take care of their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in the darker time, it's very hard to bring you back again.
I took this picture last year while this young man talked to a official in contemplating her life.
I want to tell you with joy that we got that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these call.
This was not just a bad service to those who were <unk> suicide but officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new official
This is Jason <unk>
I met him about July July last year when I got a call from a possible subject for sitting in the corner near the center.
<unk> and when I arrived, I watched Jason talking to a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Jason had only 32 years and I've flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, there were flown until here two times before from New Jersey to try to kill suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked them if we knew the story of the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent to Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out <unk> <unk> and all kind of <unk> against the man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked me, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped about <unk> he leaned on the right, and he was.
This kind of smart boy smart boy in New Jersey I had just taken off the life.
I spoke to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess that when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the great family of the family called me to see how it was.
The parents of Jason had been the order.
The damage suicide transmitted to a lot of people.
I have these questions: What would you do if a member of your family -- a friend or someone loved it was <unk>
What do you say?
So let me say?
In my experience, you don't just have to speak, but you need to hear.
You'll hear to understand.
Not <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like, because it's probably not <unk>
Just being there, you can be the turning point that you need.
If you think someone is <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have ever thought to kill their life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front can save life and be the turning point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing you can do to the <unk> and <unk> and a lost of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady, and I'd like to read you your card.
She lost her son on the 19 of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with her permit and blessing that I read it.
Man: <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still quite a bit of <unk> but to see more moments of realizing that Mike will not go home.
Mike was driving out of <unk> to San Francisco to see the party of 49 with his father the 19 of January.
It never came up there.
He called the <unk> police and <unk> it like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my home and reported that the Mike was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the late day.
Thank you very much to fight for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who has not been any bad before without suffer a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be as easy to kill it.
My prayers are you for your struggle.
<unk> <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and travel the way that his son took that day, and also the value to go out.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I told a radio call for a possible subject for a <unk> <unk> on the front sidewalk near the northern tower.
<unk> my bike. on the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> foot on the sidewalk.
When I looked at me, crossed the <unk> and stopped in that small tube that goes around the tower.
For the time and a half later, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided to turn that day back on that lane and give it to life another chance.
When Kevin came up with it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was he made it <unk> and gave the hope and the other <unk>
And you know what told me?
He said, "I'm <unk>
I stopped talking and simply <unk>
Soon after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Lord <unk> Nothing <unk> the <unk> events, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin keeps with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious of all of those traits -- but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, like it says.
We give God for you.
And so I was actually in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she wrote, <unk> when I visited the General Hospital of San Francisco that night, you were <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I had to get it up.
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and <unk> of society.
It talks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I have found in the job.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> with poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, no chance to meet me.
This is what suicide.
For most of the people who think about suicide, you wouldn't think about it to another person.
They just want your own pain <unk>
So usually, this is made only of three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've been told, and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and suicide calls around the bridge.
In those incidents that I've been directly to evolve only I've lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
And during that time, I would get my hand at three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
Moreover, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two, most of those people have said to the second side that you end up on the same side that you end up the railing that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I say to people, the bridge doesn't just connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that all and every one of us should be <unk>
suicide can prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you're not, but in your inside, you know what you are, and you ask you, how do you put you on that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved sleep that I had ever had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner way, with my inner self.
For complicated reason that I will refer to that later, when I look at this picture, I think we got it -- I <unk> it <unk>
But last October, October, I discovered that I am beginning.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some people have the value of <unk> to get rid of the constraints of the skin or for the beliefs of who around us.
They are people who always challenge the status itself, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years -- many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my agent even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is my own.
I was recorded as <unk> as <unk> because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, at my home, I would always wear this t-shirt on the head.
And my mom would say, "Why do you always take that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to make it go?
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that really, it's more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never gave myself to share my story -- not because he thought that I am bad, but why is the world to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I thank you to be a woman.
I have Mom and my family and a family that let me like me.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's an goddess <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines, who celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
This is the director of a contest of <unk> <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you participate in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if I <unk> she was over the <unk> and the <unk> and that night, I won <unk> I won <unk> and I was a third <unk> among over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was in the world of <unk> beauty.
Not a lot of people can say their first work was from queen of <unk> women, but I can do it.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I <unk> the remote <unk>
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom. I had moved to San Francisco, I called me and told me that it passed my application from the green card that I could go to live in the United States.
I <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like traveling and being a queen of <unk>
But then two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know what, if you go to the United States you can change your name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I would put two <unk> to my name.
She also sat myself in Thailand to the age of 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand to do the most sophisticated surgeries sophisticated and safe.
In that time in the United States, it was necessary to do surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license, with the name of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
It was a big time.
For some people, their identity document means to be able to drive or power to get a <unk> but for me was the driver's license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears were <unk>
I felt I could record my dream and move to New York and being model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman from New York who was living in the truth, but that <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20 November, we make a global staircase for <unk> <unk>
I'm on this stage because of a long story of people who were <unk> and stood up to the injustice.
These are Marsha F. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, no fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that there is no longer any more <unk> of <unk>
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
Would you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. So thank you first, to thank all my <unk>
To my support of support, to my parents especially, my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to <unk> young women who have <unk> and some times, when I was called me and told me that her parents couldn't accept it, I took my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Some times it work, it's not just gender identity -- that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned an gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table the subject that sometimes that particular didn't block, and that there should be a space that I would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and ask questions, and I hope you all be my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very much. <unk> Thank you.
In many <unk> and tribal societies, to parents generally know about their children, but I'm one of the few parents who is known to his daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by education by defending her rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts on 2011, at the <unk> the National Prize <unk> of peace, was made very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his dad.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the story of humanity, the story of women is the story of <unk> of violence and exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies, right from the beginning, when I was born a child, your birth <unk>
It's not welcome, nor for his father, not for his mother.
The neighborhood come, day their <unk> to the mother and no one <unk> the dad.
And a mother would take a lot to have a child.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter is getting sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> her third daughter, he feels guilty as a criminal.
Not only the electric mother, but the daughter. The daughter was just <unk> when it grows, she suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, she stays home and school suffers from his siblings.
At the age of 12 years, somehow it has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with their friends on the street, and it can move on the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes in adolescence, when it was 13 years old, he was charged to go out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of your house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the so-called honor of her father and his brothers and her family, and if you take the code of that course -- honor, the could even kill.
And it's interesting that this assumption code, not only affects the life of a <unk> also affects the lives of male male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and happiness of their sisters in behalf of the honor.
And there's a typical norm of <unk> societies, which is called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl to be too <unk> and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and accepts the choices of their father and their mother and the choices choices even if they don't.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you get it with a old man -- she has to be <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk> <unk>
If the very young, you have to accept it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the <unk>
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to their kids.
And this vicious cycle continues to go on and it keeps going.
<unk> brothers and sisters when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like how newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and I looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so much before I <unk> I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> from the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> and I called my daughter so for it.
But when I <unk> all of them were men, and I grabbed my feather, and <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she came up when she was four and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and
So you might ask, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yes, I should <unk>
They can take it for sitting in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, is a great event for a life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
One at school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when I <unk> the form of visa Canadian and was in the relative part to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was, I had never seen the names of my sisters writing in any document.
That was the reason that value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or their daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The urge to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to take it into their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've been looking at all of these good values in my school to girls and <unk>
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters and <unk> for more and more space for women in society.
But we found it with a new phenomena.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
He was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of the women in all political, economic and social.
Hundreds of schools were gone.
The girls were drawn to the school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> teenage girls and singers killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and I was scary to have those people who kill and <unk> when you're talking about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and raised up the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog blog, he offered her himself for the documentaries of the New York Times, and I spoke on every platform that he could.
And her voice was the most powerful voice.
It's <unk> as a <unk> worldwide.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and nine of October 2012, was hit to <unk> in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would tell you the ear of my wife -- "I would <unk> for what happened to my daughter to your <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please, don't you?"
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play by the cause of the truth, for the cause of peace, and the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both were on the right way and God <unk>
These little words I would spend a lot to me, and I didn't go to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and had severe pains and strong headaches because his facial nerve, was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that would go through the face of my wife.
But my daughter never got <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and my face.
I'm going to give you fine. Please don't get <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters have learned from her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, it's like any <unk> girl.
<unk> when it doesn't just have his task.
They fight with their brothers, and I'm very excited about that.
People ask me, "What is special in my <unk> that has made so bold to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently teamed up with the Google <unk> <unk> where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work that I'm talking about today about the brain of the brain, I did before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain operation.
It's still as smart or not?
It's not going to be <unk> I'll be <unk>
So after the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what a number to do, from more than a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, they would die in a few hours.
Every day, over the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemists and try to <unk> to continue to live alive.
More than I've been saved by me.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to try to get the doses of <unk> because there's no really a map of course that says it in <unk>
I started testing with something else, and I was impressed by looking at how small changes in the doses would dramatically -- my sense of who I was me, my sense of who I was me, my behavior with others.
A particularly particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried to tried doses and chemical <unk> for a man of the late 1900s, and I was surprised by looking at how I would think about it, my thinking.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the most smart person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've known a number of guys, or perhaps some versions of <unk>
It turned out as a end.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> so much <unk> to fix a problem that I had on the front, and just didn't happen that way.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of the men and what they have to do is I get better with men.
What I tried to do is to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, was to restore my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
<unk> to think about images, and that became my core reference point, how to get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas that I use to create <unk> to create <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> smallpox, and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how the minds of the mind, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are core for <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I would find the point right now, and I have already got a lot of great mental <unk> and really <unk> pretty sophisticated <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director would be able to use their imagination only to steer the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician, I could get the music of his mind?
There are amazing possibilities with this, like how creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is that, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain <unk>
So let me show you why I think we're pretty close to coming to this with two recent experiments that are done by two of the leading groups in neuroscience.
They both use MRI technology, image of functional MRI to represent the brain -- here you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and their colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person who looks at a image.
The middle of the middle shows the scan of the brain of that same individual while you get to see that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the content of the left column on the upper left of the upper left.
This was repeated in many different individuals with many different images with a lot of different outcomes.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine to see that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me show you another experiment. This is from the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They were able to convert brain waves in visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, he showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube YouTube videos, while they were <unk> their brains to create a great bunch of reactions of the brain with the video.
And then I showed you a movie with new, new, new animals, and as much as a new <unk>
So the computer using just the cerebral information on the scan of the scan to show what it seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This gave us <unk>
We're fine to get there.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember that when you see an image and when you imagine that same picture, it creates in the brain the same <unk>
This was done with <unk> brain systems that were available today, and their resolution increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you do that?
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and put my electrodes.
I didn't give me that one.
Many of them are proposing new techniques of projection by imagery, even every day, with the recent outcome of the MRI -- first we need to ask about the next, this technology will be the ultimate <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with bigger, but at this point, magnets more <unk> they only offer small improvements in the resolution, not increases for thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: rather than a bigger imams let's make better magnets.
We can create structures much more complex structures with slightly different melodies.
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort on MRI were to make a really big, right?
However, most of the recent breakthroughs in <unk> of cool and bright and bright and bright and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and receptors of FM radio in <unk> systems.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field, we will be able to be able to be able to be <unk> magnetic patterns -- <unk> frequencies of radio radius.
So we combine the magnetic patterns with the pattern processing processing patterns, we can increase the information that you can get in a single <unk>
Moreover, we can then break into layer our growing knowledge structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid, but the <unk> and <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even neural activity. This is sleep sleep.
We are going to be able to put our ideas into a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go through language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how will we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is big.
These are great questions.
It would be compelling to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few choices more than open this door.
Anyway, choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you this night about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not only of the gay century.
I think we all have <unk>
His closet is perhaps telling you to some person for the first time you love it or tell someone who's pregnant, or say somebody who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation why you have ever been on your life.
And so I all start a hard conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of have lived and have come out of that closet is universal.
It is fear, and we don't like that.
A lot of years ago, I was working on the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city and being there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits to quote the letters of <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And being <unk> that for the <unk> of my pants -- and for having me <unk> my head recently -- I would ask you about a child, I would say, "Oh, you're <unk> or <unk>
And it would be uncomfortable on the table.
<unk> my jaw a little more, I would take my coffee with a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother raised a cold look at his child.
But I would say nothing, and I would go through it.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where a child between three and ten years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised you that the next time would say something.
Would that hard.
So after a few weeks, I happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence, but this time was to be prepared to go on with the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even a snippet of the "Vagina Monologues," I would <unk>
So I took up and I went down and I went down and my back, a 10-year-old girl with a <unk> pink, staring at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a boy or <unk>
And so I took back to the way again, I stood up with me about it, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something else.
I have the short hair like the one of a boy, and I watched a child, but I am a girl, and you know, like you like to use a dress <unk> and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Because I'm more about the kind of girl from a <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and it has a fish.
You can give you a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it. I would just say, "Well, you're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest conversation to everybody ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both we were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know how color are the walls.
You just know how one feels living in a <unk>
That's how my closet is not different than you or you or you.
<unk> I'll give you a hundred reasons why to get out of my closet it was more difficult to go out of it, but this is the <unk> -- the hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who have declared bench in bench -- it's more difficult to tell it to be <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is more difficult to tell your son of five and you go to <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there's only the hard.
We need to stop getting out of what is hard for us to make it hard for the other person to make us feel better or worse in relationship to our support, and we need to just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make it feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what their walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, that had a horse tail, a <unk> and shoes.
It wasn't the militant lesbian prepared to fight any child from four to go to coffee.
I was frozen by <unk> <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my broken grenade and move only a muscle is the hardest ever ever ever ever been.
My family, my friends, full strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to not <unk> and now the world would turn around purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long -- but if you don't toss that <unk> to kill.
One of my <unk> tosses was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of the invited knew that it was gay, and by doing my <unk> <unk> in my black dressed and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who were known to me.
And after talking a moment, one of the women shouted, <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had started.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is that we have friends in St. <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
So what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite <unk> Will and Grace will Will and Grace have <unk>
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but I'm hoping to show you desperately their support, to make me know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirts, <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realizing the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask to ask someone, you are <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you want.
So as the hard conversations continue to not be my strong point.
Ask anyone who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk> <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of any point is essentially the same.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl at the coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others should know we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they might be gay, they would keep the hope that that could change.
Don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
You will never get it out of it.
And some of you can get out of them out out of them die, and they can get out of what they've done, but I'm never sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that stuff in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matter is that you want to write.
So the next time you find it in a dark closet <unk> you must know that we all have been there before.
And you can feel too yourself.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If we look at the story of how intelligence, an productive example has been the famous quote of <unk> <unk> which "The question of whether a machine can think about is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can <unk>
When I <unk> <unk> he wrote this as a critical to the computer pioneers like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I would take a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
So let's go back a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
So imagine that it's from a outer race that you don't know about the biology biology and the Earth's intelligence or intelligence of the Earth, but have incredible telescopes, and you can look at the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from an alien race that doesn't know anything about the intelligence of the Earth, you would be obliged to develop a physical theory that would explain how to a certain point in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet <unk> they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that we understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took a number of years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines that <unk> I think, towards a uniquely underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be underground.
And then finally, in business of <unk> movement, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to leverage the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action with the end of doing complex tasks.
And so taking all of these different issues and <unk> together, I asked them for a number of years ago -- there's an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's just a equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is a <unk> F, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom for action.
It acts to maximize the future of action, or to keep the open choices with a direct force, with the diversity of possible future <unk> <unk> until an imminent time future, <unk>
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future of action and maintaining the open.
And so having to account this equation, it's naturally asking, what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> artificial intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more <unk> or <unk> during their life should have a tendency to the more favorable conditions for intelligent beings like us.
But what happens if that connection to <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What happens if smart behavior doesn't only relate to the production of entropy in the long term, but actually comes directly from that?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy entropy in any system that you can find in.
<unk> <unk> were able to spend multiple evidence of animal intelligence, play games, and even earning money <unk> actions, everything without the answer to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human, here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave him a goal.
He simply decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have apps for religious robotics and human assistance technologies.
This capacity for tools will have apps on smart manufacturing and agriculture.
Moreover, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing aside from a string at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that work.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting implications for economic education, and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
So for example, here we see it successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where friends are constantly <unk> and keeps the social networking
This exact same capacity of <unk> also has apps on health care, in energy and intelligence.
Here we look at <unk> organize the lanes of a fleet of shrimp discovering with success and using the Panama Panama to expand the world from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in terms of defense and transportation and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a series of simulated actions, to successfully increase assets under their management rate.
This ability to risk risk will have huge apps in finance, and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of smart cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation all over one single equation, which leads to a system to maximize your future freedom for action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back at the beginning of the use of the term robot, the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if we were <unk> smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion,
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest implications of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of <unk> rebellion, in reverse.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all right, that the urge to take control of all the future of all the future the future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence is actually can actually emerge directly from taking control, rather than being the other way.
Another important consequence is the search for the goal.
They often ask me, how do you look for goals to learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to go to the descendants to help them make artificial artificial intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: The intelligence must be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're in a turning point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded a tremendous amount of knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Kepler NASA mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which is going to that Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint <unk> intensity of stars when planets go on in front of them, and they put a little bit of that light that we get to us.
The data collected by Kepler show the sizes of the planets besides the distance that there are between them and their stem star.
And so together, this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> like planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that get out of their <unk>
This gives clues about whether these planets that we find are safe or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this trove of potentially <unk> worlds, our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the hottest year.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us from a decade ago, are disappearing in a matter of decades.
And these environmental changes that we have caused to a global scale have raised our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a scientist, and I'm no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more the Earth-like planets on the Earth, more than our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered and the planets that we know better than our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further away from the Sun, it can be a potentially habitable world demonstrated that for a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and partly it is why we studied a lot to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> track its surface to look at clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission takes samples from the atmosphere <unk> and trying to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies now offer not just short of a short flight flights but the <unk> chance to live on Mars.
But despite all these <unk> images remind us the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the <unk> ideas, and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still in <unk> places compared to Mars.
Even in the tiniest <unk> places of the Earth is cool and full of oxygen, by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this enthusiasm on the midst of Mars and other planets will get a great and sad planets and the belief that some that Mars and the belief of some that Mars will expect to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly habitable Earth.
For a long way that I like that, I'm in deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars but say that Mars will be there to <unk> the humanity is how to imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the <unk> actually will have place later in the <unk>    Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration and land preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces in the same <unk> the goal of understanding and improve life in the future.
<unk> environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
Only you get closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep spaces, in the hostile areas and <unk> of the ground, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment, the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked, is that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there are a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of being alien life for now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to be the origin of the planets that we have this development.
It's kind of <unk> to think that only the <unk> <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and exploration.
If we believe in our ability to put up the hostile environments of Mars for the human presence, so we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And while I was on the front porch by looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were at the table table where there were <unk>
So fast I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all <unk>
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my phone phone, but at the midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to it, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe in the morning, and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but sure that not more expensive than a <unk> at a half night, so I thought despite the circumstances, I would be able to go on.
I'm a <unk> and I know a little bit about how the brain is under stress.
<unk> <unk> which increases the heart rate -- <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk> thinking.
And when I arrived at the counter of <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in the place, that I would have bad things.
Or at least if things happen bad things, that you have the chance of a total culture.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts would not survive.
I was dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> <unk> winner of the Nobel <unk> and a little embarrassed I told him that I broke the window, and I forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called retrospective <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Garry <unk> who had written about this a few years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that you could go out wrong, then I try to figure out what can do to prevent the things to be in order to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> other people are not so divine.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
At the house, you take a place for things that you lose easily.
This sounds common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved throughout thousands of years, to make a track of the location of important things, where the fish are the same -- where the fish are in the <unk> trees where tribes and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and still could find their nuts.
They didn't use the nose, but the hippocampus, that mechanism really evolved from the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move a lot, not so good for things that are moving a lot.
This is the reason for losing keys from the car and reading and <unk>
So at home you would take a place for the keys, a hook alongside the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular calculation.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and you're <unk> with that stuff you will always be there when you <unk>
What about <unk>
Take your phone phone a picture of your credit card credit card driver's credit card driver's driver's credit card to be in the cloud.
If these things lose or <unk> this can be <unk>
These are some of the most obvious.
Remember, when you're under stress your brain frees up.
The <unk> is toxic and <unk>
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we won't be at the best moment, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we all are in that situation, that we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or one of a loved decision to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of medical decisions, and in fact for the decision-making of financial decisions, and any kind of decision that we need to take out of a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the laboratory and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, attack with the brain <unk>
So you're thinking that you've got high cholesterol. It's not the best, then your doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today is even likely to know people that <unk>
So you think, "Yes, you <unk> <unk>
But there is a question that you should do then, a statistic that's got to ask for the most doctors don't want to speak, and pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number need to try.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to have surgery in any medical procedure before it helps a person.
And you should think about what kind of statistic statistic is <unk>
The number should be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But in fact, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's <unk> it's from scientists like me.
We haven't really understood the <unk> <unk>
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number required to treat the most widely <unk> which do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before it helps a person?
300.
This according to the research of the cynical researchers <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk>
I myself explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before we avoid a single heart attack or stroke or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 to get my <unk>
Why don't we <unk> <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic and it is, <unk> of the <unk> Right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in five percent of patients.
And those include things that are <unk> <unk> healthy pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, 5 percent is not too likely to go to me, still to take the <unk>
But a minute.
remember that under stress don't think of clarity.
So think about how we do this with the time, so you don't have to make the chain of math on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has spent five percent of the 300 have side effects, that are 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out <unk> by the drug that you help your medicine.
I don't say that you should or not take the <unk>
I just say you should have this conversation with your doctor with your doctor.
medical ethic is the part of the beginning of consent consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take your risks or not.
And perhaps you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air of the crash, but actually this number you need to try is quite typical.
For the surgery that more is done in the oldest men in the oldest men in the age of the prostate -- the number necessary to try to try to be <unk>
So it is, 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And side effects in that case, are produced in 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you have luck and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only one year or two.
So the idea of the <unk> is to think before the questions that you can have to make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice for a lot of times, they want a higher life free of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot of pain to the <unk>
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change it in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they go out a lot of systems.
There's a evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> to face with a <unk> you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, not directly.
Unfortunately, one of the things that go out of the window during those moments of stress is the logical thinking, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown it.
So we need to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail in a while.
The idea is to think about the future how they might be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that help to minimize harm, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> at the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination along with the door, with a key way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of messages that I haven't read before.
So I am not too clean, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means <unk>
If you're playing an musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more smooth.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree there, you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be, never <unk> a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
French standard language came over the 1920s, and over the time of time, he mixed with local, and developed the language we know today as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that the sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, actually in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a <unk> world is as if I lived in a foreign country, following their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound one?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to the sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example ...
"Not <unk> <unk>
Don't do a lot of noise at eating the bag of <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure you don't <unk> the <unk> in the <unk>
This is all I call <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is about coming next.
From there, this drawing is.
<unk>
So let's go to go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds of <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to the sound.
This is the signal to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it with my thumb, it doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines in paper.
In 2008, 2008, I had the opportunity to travel in Berlin, Germany, for a artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that I called me the <unk>
There were no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
It's going to be <unk> more than art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't only experience the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my practice.
And everything that had taught me in sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started creating a new body of work.
And when I presented to the art community, I was astonished with the amount of support and attention that I had.
I realized that sound is like money, power -- the social currency.
In the background of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was a kind of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that I could <unk> myself and my art work, or I could <unk>
I chose to be <unk>
There's a massive culture around the spoken language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in the current society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with a lot of different <unk>
And their voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when you ask <unk> your voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value something like taking a loan to a high school rate.
If I'm not going to continue to continue this practice, I feel that I could <unk> in <unk> and not having any social value.
So with the sound like my new artistic art, <unk> in the world of the music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note you can't capture and expressing the paper.
And the same thing can say a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the signals as much as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano to understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> <unk> in many different parameters are <unk>
If you're mapping a different <unk> for every finger while you touch the piano -- like the facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand and so as you touch the piano -- English is a linear language, as if you get just a key at the time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 toes in the way to express a concept of clear or <unk>
If only one would change the chord -- it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of <unk> <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters <unk> you can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal in it."
This is the <unk> sign in it."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the glasses of music?
If I had to create a sign and you would pass it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun goes out and put it up.
This is all day."
If you take it up, and you take the <unk> and you can get the speed -- visually looks like a piece of music piece.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can say <unk> <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing here.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents the time in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present one is closer to and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite idea with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time -- we will pass it again."
<unk> <unk> is a piece of music with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk> the same time."
Look at <unk> right hand -- <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to teach you a way of the hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands on the top.
Now we're going to do so much in your head like your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> the same time."
Yes, very good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a minute, it's a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and television languages worldwide.
The second one I'd like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third one, please, <unk> again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good work.
Look at how three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest. But they pass very different roots.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and rich as the music.
However, nowadays, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, it doesn't have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this might be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And perhaps people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> You don't have to hear the music.
<unk> is a rich trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to give you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would tell me, "Can you do it all, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble bubble or a bubble of ignorance I should say, because the adults would tell us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I got to get older, I found out that the adults also <unk> and they're not very good for cleaning the ones from others.
The time happened, now I'm an adult and I teach the invention of the <unk> of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk through the beach, <unk> lots of trash.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't <unk>
It's sad to say, but today more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastics.
It's something creepy.
And in the last few decades, we have been coming out with these big vessels and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's too expensive to use those huge boats as well.
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dreamed of making a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a <unk>
We started building this <unk> of work with <unk> so that the kids very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'll tell you, the kids who create electrical tools feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastics.
We collect plastic and we move it into the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of his <unk>
That's what we do.
I'll leave you with my students.
My work is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to do it in something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting bits of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through the use of a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the children would get a lot with robots.
And then we created what we call a <unk>
We're so quick in creating prototypes that we end up before lunch.
And we transform light lights, and <unk> and <unk> in a floating robot that will be slowly moving across the water, and by plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see pieces of plastic floating down through the device while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of every single <unk> to get a basic estimate of plastic in water.
<unk> this invention step on on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that somebody would get it to even more.
The cool thing in this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I'm looking at my favorite <unk> but my students in Hong Kong are <unk>
You can see the news, you know, the Internet -- and you get it into this picture.
A child, perhaps less than 10 years, cleaning a oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is <unk> the water where you live the place where you live.
You can also see the water is brown the mud and the oil also are brown color and when it all <unk> is very hard to see what is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We build a first prototype of a <unk> that can be <unk> through all sorts of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what's in the water.
We would take this prototype with a sensor, and we send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help <unk> to other kids.
I was looking at a problem to <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further away, perhaps to deal with a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and perhaps remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroyed various cities on the east coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant to contemplate a nuclear power to close to water.
And today, according to the average reports from 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the mass of the radiation disappeared from the coast coast and the majority, at the moment, it has a safe thing, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little more complicated than that.
I've come back to <unk> every year from the accident and doing independent way with other scientists, the Earth, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> parents don't know.
But every night you go to the center of <unk> here you see the use of <unk>
It might seem to do it seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with <unk> all their life.
Along with them we argue the data that day and we talked about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear energy plant.
We create the map of <unk> <unk> pigments to represent data in real time from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain <unk>
So we were able to notice that the radioactive powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system, and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But in the basis of this we organize an civil budget, the closest close to the nuclear power to date.
We zoom up to 1.5 miles of the nuclear marketplace, and with the help of fishermen in the area we were collecting <unk> sediments with a <unk> of sediment as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work in these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all these things.
So the classroom turned a little bit too much so much so much so that we found an industrial facility in Hong Kong and we converted it into the largest space for social and environmental impact.
It's in the heart of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry -- a little bit of biology, of optical essentially, you can build almost all over there.
It's also a place where the adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where the adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk>
For example.
Or, we can help in the mobility of the old age transforming their standard vehicles, in new vehicles in new vehicles.
Plastic plastic, oil and <unk> are terrible, terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are <unk>
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So ordinary citizens, <unk> <unk> we need to prepare the next generation so that you care about the environment and the people, and so you can really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two different design cultures, more opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of steel, pieces -- the other one of a silk <unk>
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One puts on the environment, the other thing I thought about.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Miguel angel said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a shape that will fight for free.
The <unk> was only a tool for Miguel imagination.
But the alive are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we have all the information required for every cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of making and production production.
<unk> lines have dictated a world made of place, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as <unk> from <unk> parts with different function.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think about the human skin for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> pores are <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
You act primarily like filter, the other mainly as a barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there is no <unk> no <unk>
It's a system that varies gradually their functionality through <unk> variation.
Here's a divided screen, which represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and an architect and the gene between the machine and an organism, between the machine and the growth, between the assembly and growth, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
So these two visions of the world, my left hemisphere, and the right and synthetic analysis shows in both screens after me.
My work, in its simplest level, it tries to bring these two visions of the world, away from the assembly and getting up to growth.
You probably ask why now?
Why couldn't it be possible this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment, where four disciplines that gives designers access to tools that we never had access to that before.
And in the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, structures and tools through scales, big scale, like this robotic arm with a <unk> of <unk> with a <unk> of <unk> that one day not too far -- to print <unk> buildings, and graphics to the <unk> of genetically <unk> <unk>
Here we have <unk> <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture and has created a screen where every aperture of the light and the heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> This was for a <unk> fashion <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> is like a second skin made from a single piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with <unk> 3D printing -- we print this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> between cells.
This helmet is combining rigid materials and <unk> at the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this high resolution of high resolution and the <unk> instruments allows us to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the bottom-up structure of our tissues.
We also designed an acoustic chair a chair to the very comfortable <unk> and also it makes the sound.
The professor Carter <unk> my collaborator, went back to nature for <unk> and designing this pattern of surface <unk> it becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the points of pressure in the human body.
Its surface, as in nature, it varies its functionality not by addition to another material or another <unk> but <unk> continually and <unk>
But it's the <unk> nature.
There are no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a Muslim Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Bible <unk> and one of them came up and to define a lot of what it was.
As she said, "For the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a tree <unk> <unk>
For that first tree. tree there is no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree.
Instead, the land made trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would be design if objects were made of a single piece of time.
Let me go to a better state of <unk>
So we look for the <unk> material the kind of material of the <unk> tree.
The second <unk> most abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune their properties, we could generate structures in a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  we do a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations -- we have been able to achieve a broad range of properties, from dark and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
In order to print the large-scale structures on the scale of a system with multiple <unk> of <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march, and create these structures made of a only three material in a half three of <unk>
When the pieces are ready, it leaves dry to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process of printing were used to contain <unk> <unk> that appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that do with no problems of <unk> <unk> and if it extends even more to windows.
A <unk> tree.
It was working with an ancient material -- one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water, and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a <unk> structure of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best two: for objects that are designed for <unk> <unk> living life and put on the ground, they'll grow up a tree.
The match for our next exploration using the same principles of design was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility to create clothes to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we need to master bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> board, we made our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology as the natural <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological displays within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothing, it would be <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans, and in the <unk> of fresh water.
And second, E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human neighbors.
It turns out the light in sugar, the other uses sugar and produces realistic vehicles for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, he never got <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but by design.
To contain these relationships, we've created a only channel that looks like a <unk> tract that will help you take these bacteria and to make your function of way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, we would take the properties of the material according to the <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> <unk> more transparent channels.
This system is <unk> <unk> when it stretches out of one end to each other, it's 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels in life in their clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> he said, "We are new, <unk> creatures -- only half is <unk>
What if design would get the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the matter of it.
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin <unk> the domestic tissue, and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer made material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do that like this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture a home within which they <unk>
The manufacture of <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It's doing it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
A acts as a structure, the one is the glue or the <unk> connecting those fibers to each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first is turn in the environment, creates a structure of tension, and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works complex, <unk> a small magnet to the head of a silk worm <unk>
We put it into a box with functional sensors and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of <unk>
However, when you put the silk worm on a plane, not in a box, not in a box, we realized that we would have a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different backgrounds, different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, composition, the structure of the <unk> is transmitted directly by the environment.
They often <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk <unk> and it uses the <unk> industry.
We found that designing these templates we could shape the <unk> <unk> without boiling silk.
It's <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we had this process to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot doing silk, and we put it on our site.
We knew that silk worms are <unk> towards more dark and darker areas, so we use a solar diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the ray of light and the heat of silk worms over structure.
We were prepared to get the <unk>
We are going to give you <unk> silk worms, silk <unk>
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short ones.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is great integrity, and it was correct.
By <unk> silk silk about silk <unk> <unk> give all this pavilion their integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, we had <unk> silk worms, <unk> miles.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of <unk>
<unk> after <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
An <unk> silk is using a robotic arm, the other full <unk>
If the last border of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us, to form a <unk> ecology, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
What brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new design of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired by nature to a cultural nature in design, which requires us, for the first time, that we do in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can do it with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm someone who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In the school I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and I took place on the websites and I had a place to place on the room in a orange gang, called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And I generally like to try and persist and persist in anyway, for having spent a long time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer challenging to <unk>
And I have to go on.
But then I would tell you about something else, something totally different -- and I would tell you about it, and I'll leave you on it, and I am going to be <unk> and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to go on.
But then I'd like to find out something new and different and I'd like to go into it.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I was not sure how I was going to turn this up in a career.
I thought I had to pick a thing to deny all my friends and <unk> to <unk>
The other reason I caused it so much anxiety -- it was a little bit more personal.
I worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for not <unk> at all.
I worried about the engagement, or to be <unk> or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to get me back then.
<unk> themselves, where learned the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where you have learned it from culture.
So you ask you first, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that no one cares about what we would look at that age.
It's considered a naive issue to provoke cute answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> here.
This question takes us again and again as we go back in a different forms, I will go back to the high school of high school, they ask them that you're going to choose in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before what you take away from the dream.
Why?
If this issue is inspired by children to dream what they might be, not inspires dreaming of dreaming of what they might be.
In fact, it does exactly what you want to be, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond with 20 different things, even though adult <unk> maybe <unk> and say, "Oh, what is cute, but you can't be a <unk> of <unk> and <unk>
You've got to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> of <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> and creative <unk>
But most of the kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have a choice.
But it's more than that.
The notion of <unk> life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of the fate or the real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something that you spend during your time on this ground, and you have to figure out what that thing and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that raise their curiosity and a lot of different things that want to do?
There is no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel it alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a breath, to say.
It could help if you divide in three <unk> multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that you can get the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
In the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was the one who was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term that you might like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> like limitation or woe you should win.
But what I've learned talking about with people and writing about these ideas on my website, which is that there are huge strengths to be this way.
Here are three superpowers to <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in <unk> visualization of data, travel, math and design, at starting <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with the only idea of their <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
Out of the new ideas.
And <unk> with all of their background, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is the rapid learning.
When the <unk> are interested in something, we're going to it.
We see everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to being <unk> for being <unk> in the past, and this means that we have less afraid to try new things out of testing new things and out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines and we bring everything that we've learned to every new area that we <unk> so we rarely start out of zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full time and an independent <unk>
As a child said, "We have an amazing capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before it was to become a writer <unk> was <unk> financial financial.
He had to learn the fastest sales mechanics when they started their <unk> and this skill helps him to write exquisite launches for the editors.
<unk> is a loss of time to get to what you're going to do, even if at the end, you <unk>
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that you might not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. I mean, the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, including a sheet of websites, sometimes a <unk> sometimes <unk> sometimes a teacher, and sometimes it appears James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> magazine defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> which are the individuals and organizations that can <unk> to meet the market needs the ones that we really <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that they could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, it will be <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers, not conventional to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in his heart.
<unk> from the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams get up from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
<unk> can dive in depth and put in ideas, and the <unk> it provides a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we all should design lives and race that we have to interact with how we're connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a large part of them would be told to simply be more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said that, if there's one thing that you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the inner <unk> whatever it is.
If you're a heart specialist then, you know, for all the media.
That's where you will give the best thing.
But for the <unk> in the room -- including those of you who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,   I say, <unk> with their many passions.
Follow her curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
The intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more authentic and happy.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman called <unk> he took it to a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but I would go for her until unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> took a <unk> and they found weird plates and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If I had been living alive today, we couldn't give it to her more help than the one that I had gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call disease disease.
From <unk> medicine has been a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> many treatments for HIV, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But a little bit of the treatment of Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million across the world.
But by 2050, will affect 150 million than by the way, including many of you.
If you wait to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of every two.
In other words, there's the chance that the chance that you spend their years <unk> with Alzheimer's disease or helping care to a friend or being like Alzheimer's.
In the United States, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare spent on disease disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and their costs -- a increase in five times in 2050, as the generation of the <unk> <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death from all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you cannot be able to heal or even slow its development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases, because we spend less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government, spend 10 times more every year in cancer research that despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and cause a number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time you know, but all the <unk> <unk> <unk> is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, everybody even, scientists, Alzheimer's with aging.
We thought to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you just look at a picture of a healthy human brain, compared to the <unk> patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to engaging a severe loss of memory and abilities, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease, significantly life expectancy and it's always <unk>
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found tectonic plates, strangers on the brain of <unk> a century.
For nearly a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think a protein molecule like a piece of paper that is folds as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds out, these points <unk> end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points <unk> stay in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plate plate and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University, trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of steps, and the identification of what happens is complex, as a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that you can do, and then create a drug that do it.
Until recently, most of the cables have shrunk the cables and waited the best.
But now there are a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, physical chemicals, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new type of drugs that stores specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last outcomes.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened to the test of these drugs in <unk>
These are a healthy worms and you can see that you're moving with normal.
So these grubs, on the other hand, have molecules of protein that they stick with each other, as human disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs at a early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive <unk> but research like this shows that Alzheimer's disease is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years, there are real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope to overcome Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to warn you that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we get it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have visited more research and <unk> pressure on governments and <unk>
That was essential to advance the HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the severe victims of their loved ones, day and night, are often too <unk> to get out and advocate for change.
So, really depends on you.
Alzheimer's isn't the most of the genetic disease.
All the world with a brain is a <unk>
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
<unk> this article at the <unk> Heart column of the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience of it, I myself would end up one night in the last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers will be <unk> to be 36 more and more personal questions and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you would go to another person?
And <unk>
And so they are <unk> these are more and more life.
Number <unk> <unk> I would really tell you about your partner what you like about him or it, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've ever met.
When I found myself with this study a few years ago, a thing that really struck me the attention, the part that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the laboratory to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the time to try this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to <unk>
However, we were <unk> and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I sent it to the column Love Love about a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's <unk> so I guess some of you are probably asking some of you to get it up there?
And the reason I think that I think is because I've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the topic.
A week before I published the article very nervous.
I had been working on an romantic book in the last few years, so I had <unk> to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog input can get a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just about my Facebook friends and I imagined that my article in the New York Times would have a number of thousands of view.
And that has been a good burden on a relatively new relationship.
But as he realized, I had no idea.
The article came up on a Friday at night, and I had the Saturday Saturday, this happened in my blog.
And Sunday, I had called the Digital Show and the Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million <unk> and I was, to say something -- little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with us by having a <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that the love life of a has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people would call it or I was about what they did every day for weeks, always, first the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was setting this talk, I made a quick search for my email with the phrase: <unk> still <unk>
And several messages came out immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed in radio and <unk>
Even I gave a talk, and a woman chooses to the stage, "Hey <unk> where your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for St. <unk> who included the experiences of the readers at trying to study them with different degrees of success.
So my first urge to all of this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both have a public onset together.
<unk> television interviews, and <unk> orders from all of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the <unk> icons of the <unk> process, a range of <unk> that I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know whether the study worked -- they wanted to know whether they were actually able to figure out whether I was able to produce love -- not just a adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, mostly people posed the wrong question.
How do you know whether you get them together or not, and you can also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would do the experience of doing these 36 questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
In time of that, I was looking for <unk> approach to <unk> between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study worked.
Participants felt closer to doing it. Many studies later -- they also used the protocol -- <unk> <unk> as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They have been used between members of the police and the community, and they've used it among people of <unk> political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, that combines questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately he never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a small college university university and then a student came to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed to be <unk> by it.
And I said, you want to say that you would tell you about the person who would do it.
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, But it became better friends?
<unk> that I did do better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it's about love.
I found myself with the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really tough group.
I had that relationship since I had 20, which I had 20, which I was mostly my entire adulthood, and he had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I went to me in science.
And it was all I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that to sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time, I thought I just went to the book that I would write but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was inspired by the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to be as bad as I sat back then.
And this whole knowledge has been useful in one or another way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I was.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than I can help me demand me.
What I'm looking for about love is an assurance not only to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but that will continue to be <unk> in the person that I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee about the people when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story that media told about 36 questions is that there might be a shortcut to <unk>
There might be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk of risk, and this is a very <unk> story because they love us feel beautifully, but it's also frightening.
But I think when it's about love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that I mean, still follow together?
And their content with an answer.
So more than a question, we need to make questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who not?
How would it stay in love when things would be <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with the doubt of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a more <unk> conversation about what means to love someone.
So, if you want the brief version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we <unk> we still follow together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing to stay <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my favorite article -- love didn't happen.
<unk> <unk> because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little at reading now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I had no whole thing that that choice was.
I didn't think of how many times we would have both to take that decision and how long I would have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always pick me or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and answered 36 questions, I have to have to love somebody so generous, kind of fun and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest <unk>
But what I've done in change, is to convert my relationship into the kind of myth where I don't think of it.
And what I'm going to do, and what maybe will spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't know.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's scary, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a little <unk> on complete mountain and in a way, I was like a <unk> of the forest in a way.
The city of New York ago, a time --  -- something that I really hit me but more details later.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and <unk> a bill of a dollar, a pen and a fork on her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens found this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's <unk> because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
So at a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from field and do and do and all those things <unk> and I was doing a <unk> for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I started him all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style Agnes Martin, the <unk> and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother has fear of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more confident in the canvas, I think I could <unk>
Instead, it happened to the opposite: somehow it seemed to be a big way -- as if it was that it would be the text with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
And this time, I started adding electronic elements. We would find weird bottles, that I could find out the street, all I could find out because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> drawing like it does about a body in the crime scene.
And I took objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, we need to make an idea.
Then I made some insects and strangers.
It was very fun to draw on the layer of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to take my girlfriend to dinner, for example, to go <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point I got interested in the human way, sculptures of the natural size of human beings in the <unk>
It was great, except for one thing, I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the quad was going to kill.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass, similar to the drawing on a window on a window, then in another window and another window, and I had all these windows together that put together a three-dimensional composition there.
And this really worked. And so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work would have something very big, I call <unk>
For <unk> I was inspired by a large measure in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
You've heard it.
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 meters long.
It has double faces, which is 10 meters old.
It's a little bit awkward.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with heads of animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, to this <unk> <unk> where it <unk>
This is where creatures with heads of animals go to the <unk> ready for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a god that is attached to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
But anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while from the other hand they get out clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand in which I <unk>
And then, when you go on the other side, you have a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it spits out of this <unk>
It also has a half meters long, a <unk> tail that unites the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn on the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go up, you know.
His tail ends up in a balloon <unk> made from suicide cards.
They have <unk>
They were made in the 1980s, as if they were baseball baseball cards.
Very <unk> to his time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's about a six year-old project.
Each one is an file.
But each one is acting as a kind of file in form of being human, and travel in <unk> groups, four or 12 or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's running years.
Each one is basically a <unk> microscope, which weighs 1.3 pounds with a flying human.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> is the chest, you can take care of the <unk>
I'm going to show you for the rest of the body, there's a waterfall coming out of the chest, and you cover the penis or whatever, or whatever you have, a kind of thing <unk>
It's a quick refresher on these pieces because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a <unk> body.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between both.
There are some pills coming out and go into the head of this strange statue
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
You can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> like boxes that we live.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
Inside this box is a physical, a neuroscientist, a a musician, a musician, a musician, a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a school, a <unk> arm, which spreads all the content we do in the world; and a garden.
<unk> the box and all of the people in it hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box in which it's living on.
And together we got to realize that we all are together in this, that this illusion that we are different -- these concepts of countries, from the borders, of religion, it doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start sharing those things with <unk> and <unk> all we're going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your mind?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the guts and other organs.
So I'll take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system, so that any possible medication effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any medication <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with AIDS.
When you take drugs -- these are <unk> to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and will increase the cancer cells.
But they're also known for their side effects, which is mostly negative, because in time that it takes to the stream to the <unk> <unk> and worse and worse even for the time that you take to your fate, which is where it's more important: in the HIV consumption.
These are regions of the body as the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where viruses is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood vessel of patients that are going on to regulate drugs with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the <unk> of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with current drugs, which is a treatment treatment treatment in its own.
One day, I sat up and I thought to make the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for care of wounds and surgery surgery can be used for any <unk> including transportation <unk>
In fact, we are using laser pulses to open up or <unk> holes in extremely small holes that open and closed almost the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best thing is they say, "What is that <unk>
We put a little bit of laser ray of laser <unk> about the HIV <unk> while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of time.
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> plates, but the goal is to take this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first brain, which is our laser -- we're going to make a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second brain, which is a camera to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head -- a <unk> which means the drug allows it to directly directly on the site of infection, while laser is used again to keep the open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the total of the HIV of the body.
Yeah.
This is the dream of all the <unk> <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I have studied armed groups, not <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these gravitational school agents and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to <unk>
I make the field work in the world of politics and at the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because war has changed.
I used to be a dispute between states.
It's not.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors now.
For example, from <unk> peace arrangements between 1975, and 2011, <unk> signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> even we should be <unk> or <unk> in any kind of resolution of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and the political struggle is <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for its violent we're against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> also has established a political game, a social networking network, and an military device.
In the same way, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups do more than just shooting.
They're multitasking it.
<unk> a complex machinery of communication, radio stations. channels.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups are also doing something else -- they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, they put a professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> provides all these services and more.
armed groups are also trying to conquer the population offering something that the state didn't make security and protected.
The promotion of the Taliban in a Afghanistan signed up for war or even the beginning of the <unk> of <unk> you can also understand the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a blood price.
But in general, provide social services means filling a vacuum, a <unk> gap by government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral triumph of 2006 from Palestinian Hamas cannot be able to recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill gaps <unk> by government, and emerge like armed and political groups, participate in nonviolent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated are these organizations, less we can <unk> as something contrary to a state.
How would you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory they run all their functions, collect the trash -- running the <unk> system.
It's a <unk>
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states of <unk> nations with no state and <unk> and the weakest of the Middle East -- and the more <unk> the <unk> actors and <unk>
This is important for governments, because to counteract these groups are going to have to invest more in the media tools.
<unk> that government gap has to be in the middle of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and strengthen peace.
If we understand better at <unk> groups, we will understand better what incentives to offer the transition from violence to the violence.
In this new <unk> between states and actors, and actors, military power can make some <unk> but we don't have peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill out that content gap that allowed these groups of government that allowed these groups thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid that it will accept openly <unk> it would be unfair for <unk>
I'm <unk> but quite bad.
And so I would tell you as a bad feminist.
Or, at least I wrote a paper, and a book called <unk> <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant myself and a <unk> <unk> has become a larger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these <unk> women -- with the men and the sex. Like if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated in the world and anger, in particular, it seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the <unk> who might be a feminist.
It's going to be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a word taboo and unpleasant.
I <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which begs too much with high self-worth and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
With time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
It would be the same good luck for the same job.
We have a right to travel around the world like <unk> <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use it easy and accessible the contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have in account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We're people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> <unk> skills and a lot more.
We have to have to have these differences, and how we engage ourselves in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a mess.
I'm full of <unk>
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I lead to the work, I hear rap music to all volume.
Though the letter degrades the women and <unk> to me deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> of the yin yang is amazing.
<unk> actually with your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you hit the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm totally <unk> by my musical <unk>
I believe in the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk>  all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> the <unk> and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The rose is my favorite color.
<unk> the fashion magazines and the good stuff.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> stories that make it happen.
Some of my girls are more <unk>
If a woman wants to take the name of her husband, is her election, and I'm not the one for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raising his children, I don't accept that election, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same election, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that the women are more vulnerable in a way that women are more vulnerable to <unk>
We would have this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the color of color, the gay workers, gay women, and <unk> for white, <unk> and <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist man.
It's also going on the following: As a geneticist, I feel a lot of <unk>
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we are going to be <unk>
When we go to the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself with that <unk> before I try to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders are afraid of being destroyed as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> by fear of what that tag is in fear to not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do with a little realistic expectations.
Let's take for example <unk> or like I call it the <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist man.
In the <unk> Music Music <unk> in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> three meters tall.
It was a <unk> show, to see this star <unk> embracing feminism and do to know the women and the young men who be feminist is something to be proud.
<unk> the time, cultural critics started endless arguments if they were <unk> it was or not a feminist.
<unk> his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection is because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
Let's go much beyond the sensible critical and <unk> to make it <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
Bad feminism, or more well, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give up the action and be a little more brave.
If I listen to music, I am creating a lawsuit for artists that would be more happy to give up a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until <unk> change effectively their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does their music be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worst choice.
But when bad choices do this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve to us and is our responsibility.
I think of three and four years.
It's two girls and <unk> and bright and also very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
And they are going to be asked by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice would be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to sexual violence against women as sports, -- <unk> <unk>
We can change the radio of radio when we listen to women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the movie in another part when movies don't treat women more than as <unk> objects.
We can stop support of professional sports where athletes treat their companions as <unk>
In any case, men, especially men, heterosexual men, they can say, "No, I'm not going to post it in his project to participate in his project, or to work with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
For those of us who are <unk> but we're going to be able to participate in these sorts of projects, we can also be able to be included as much as we are <unk> to overcome the barriers to the jobs.
Because we are not <unk> <unk> no these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements are going to mean.
We can make these small acts of bravery and hope that our choices will come to the top, people in the power directors and producers of cinema and music, <unk> <unk> people who can take great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also tell us with bravery our niece, <unk> or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be <unk>
This is truth because of many reasons, but I tell you, mostly because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was a incident.
I call it incident to do what happened.
A few kids told me when I was too young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I didn't believe I could say something that might matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was <unk> in a stronger version of myself.
So the words of those women who could understand a story like me, and the women who looked like me and they knew what meant to live in this world if you got the brown skin there.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it wasn't nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also found that if I was a little brave another woman I could hear me and see that none of us is the nothing that the world is about telling us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the another, I maintain the hard reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad discrepancy I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think about what I do, and what I do, without abandon everything that makes me human.
I hope we all do the same.
I hope we can all be a little courageous, when you get a little bit of <unk>
Just after Christmas, last year -- <unk> children in California, they had <unk> to have visited <unk> or by being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be terrible for a child with a <unk> immune system is one of the most unlikely diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak hadn't been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to still be <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed about autism and vaccines were <unk> Darfur, and marked by being a <unk> fraud for the British Medical Medical School.
Don't believe the majority of smart scientists that vaccines cause vaccines is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism growth in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very odd disease.
So the few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about she thought to develop all their professional life without seeing a single case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates kept stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1980s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> refer to autism, as an epidemic as if I could <unk> another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the heart Control Center for Disease Control which is going on, tend to rely on phrases like <unk> <unk> and a better detection of <unk> to explain these numbers <unk>
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who is looking at the face of their son of two years, the visual contact, the visual.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be <unk> why were they so <unk> in the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism, so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is to do with slow progress and <unk> from science that with the wrong power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story was <unk> and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinic.
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who were looking at <unk> worlds <unk> to the people around them, even their own parents.
They could fun for hours for hours by waving the hands in their faces, but they were <unk> from panic by <unk> as when he didn't put their favorite toy in his usual place without knowing it.
In the basis of the base of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1980s, as the main authority of the world on the subject, declared that I had seen less than 150 real cases of its syndrome as <unk> references the <unk> of places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to <unk> <unk> but now we know that epilepsy, is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he would become nine percent of every 10 children sent by other doctors to his office, and they would not give you a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold parents and <unk>
These kids, he said, they have been careful in a refrigerator.
At the same time, though, <unk> I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the children in his clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite record, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills saying things like children were just <unk> what they heard their parents had been hearing desperate to win their <unk>
As a result, autism became source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becomes invisible to the world generally.
<unk> wasn't until the 1970s, that researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist, I thought that the theory of <unk> mothers of <unk> was quite stupid.
She and her husband John were warm, and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raising a child as opposed to no special education, no special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
In order to defend for the National Health Service, of Health who had more resources for autistic children, and their fellow <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have been 30 before.
We ran a study of prevalence prevalence in the general population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw out of clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism, was much more <unk> and diverse was <unk>
Some kids couldn't speak at all. When others were <unk> in their fascination in the <unk> or the <unk> of <unk>
In the other way, these kids didn't fit in beautiful frames and <unk> as he said <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were all over trying to make sense of their data.
How no one hadn't realized these children before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then <unk> buried under the <unk> of a terrible time that no one wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I stopped <unk> I was running on their own work.
There was even a translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> talked German, and he took him for it.
The document gives an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man called Hans <unk> who was running a integrated clinic with a school in Vienna in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
And the morning in his clinic started with kinds of exercises with music, and the children followed their games at the late evening.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as disabled <unk> of life that required <unk> forms of support and spaces.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, as a patient called her little teachers, and he started to help the development of education methods that were particularly good for them.
<unk> <unk> saw autism as a diverse continuum that had been, an amazing variety of <unk> and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they've always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in the pop culture as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism, is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong with autism, as well as the parents were the <unk>
In the next few years, they worked quietly with the American American Association to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes came into <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> for a broad and <unk> model.
These changes didn't fall in broken <unk>
<unk> when I <unk> and Judith worked out to go to reform these <unk> people from all the world to see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before it came out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, only a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and parents from everybody knew what autism was.
At the same time, they introduced the first clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I wasn't supposed to have a connection with that little circle of experts to achieve a diagnosis for his child.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> just like they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact that they were hoping that it were, so that the people with autism, and their families finally would support the support and services.
So Andrew <unk> came to blaming vaccines for the increase in <unk> a simple, powerful, and <unk> story as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the center of prevention that one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right now, the autistic are one of the world's largest <unk> groups.
In the last few years, people have come together on the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles are by solving by new advances doctors, <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with <unk> it doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> the normal human brain is easily <unk> <unk> social <unk> and suffers from a attention deficit to the details.
Certainly autistic people have a difficulties to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> that I believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism, employers are in understanding of teachers, employers and community communities and parents with faith in the potential of their kids.
A autistic woman called <unk> <unk> said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we go to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to make the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to lose any of the brain.
Thank you.
