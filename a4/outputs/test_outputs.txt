You know what I do is I write for the kids, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, most read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or leather or leather and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany usually is something that fell into the place.
You just have to flip the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle years in the middle school in the middle school in <unk> Ohio where I was the weird class of class.
When I went down to bleed every week in the bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the room of the teachers.
They did it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumbnail and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working on organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults never come to know us.
You could send it to Ohio and please bring that man to that guy that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have a pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to stand up with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we were <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and take care of her family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was
It's something we knew how to do.
And as a woman who wanted <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a <unk> box, and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed it, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked about was made in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I saved it.
And you know that that part of life needs all the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm so happy today that I talked about a lot of this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our job to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separate from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> them around the water almost 60 feet, and I couldn't even more than think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
The <unk> are born when we fall from glaciers or break up the ice walls.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and hold onto the end, while others can't afford to be more and <unk> in a <unk> passionate <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> who are isolated apart, and in a big measure as we see us sometimes as human.
But reality is the opposite.
As it melts a <unk> I'm breathing its atmosphere <unk>
So as a iceberg melts fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come back to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are in that way, and they'll never exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Some of the ice in the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed in Greenland.
It's unlikely to be actually going to witness a <unk> iceberg here.
Here you go.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg <unk>
It's about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two partners in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same moment, every one of a baby <unk> Okay.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to <unk> too much in the details of conception, because if they stop to think about the conception in yeah, you're not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in an case, the chromosome is the chromosome and the sperm is attached to the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X X of sperm joins up to the X X chromosome.
They both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to them later.
In my activity floor to be <unk>
In one of my <unk> I work with the story of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people use anatomy -- that -- of human bodies, how they have considered body fluids.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients, or as I say sometimes, we will be excited about people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've been working with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with <unk> twins, two people within a same body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've been working with a lot of people with sex -- individuals whose physics of physics does not fit into male and female <unk>
In basic lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> many forms.
I'm going to give you some examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't fit into the male forms or a female.
For instance, there is the case of the individual <unk> <unk> which gene <unk> of the chromosome and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that will become <unk>
And then, in <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual doesn't react to testosterone, the body doesn't react to it.
It's <unk> <unk>
So, there are high levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a result, the body develops in a typically female.
When <unk> the baby looks like a child.
It's a girl. He's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when puberty, it is growing up and developing the breast -- but it doesn't have the menstrual period when somebody realizes something is happening.
After doing tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and a <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think about a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called glands <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
The majority of women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman, not know its structure, I think I would be a typical woman -- most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain, the woman who was born with <unk> who has <unk> <unk>
That's why sex is complicated -- it's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way you can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old boy and born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sex with her, she was wearing a life like a boy and I had just found that I had <unk> and a <unk>
It had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
It had 20th chromosomes.
As a consequence, the devil, were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component is typically male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> nothing.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having a medical problem caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, I was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> that is, they have <unk> tissue wrapped in tissue tissue.
We don't know exactly why it is.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- we are <unk> twins, or <unk> twins, and <unk> <unk> surgery is not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that they were going to go into several surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up with a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have an identity <unk> <unk> being black wants to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very rough ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very romantic.
Imagine how surprising it is to have children who are born like two people within a same body.
The most recent case is the past year with the <unk> South Africa <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to ask, "What do you test are going to be able to determine whether <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that don't have such a test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace an online line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more it goes on, the more we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were <unk> categories that are <unk> directly with <unk> categories -- are much more <unk> than they would be.
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out to be much more complicated than the terminology would be.
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with the chimpanzees.
What about the <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we think about the science we get more and more in a uncomfortable area where we have to recognize that <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles in the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which one body gets human, and it has different rights to the <unk>
There are very busy discussions today in day -- not public -- but it does look inside the <unk> of when somebody is considered killed.
Our ancestors never had to do it with this question of if somebody was dead.
As a lot of you put a pen in front of the nose and if he was still not going to get it.
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, take a vital organs of a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with the dilemma of figuring out really somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that you get nervous.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought we were going to be thought of.
It was <unk> from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension -- first I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of parents -- <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find myself every single time watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not the music, which is totally <unk>
This is why it happened in <unk> with the husbands <unk>
Parents -- <unk> were to me, the first activists of the anatomy activists and explain why.
What they were looking for, was a concept of <unk> and I would plug it with another one which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what our parents <unk> our soldiers -- <unk> was the idea of <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that it was going to be able to be able to be able to get political power from the law of blood from the father to the father and then to the son, etc.
Parents -- <unk> rejected that idea and replace it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game of play, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, that was quite radical.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where two things were <unk>
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it is very clear, if you look at the story of Parents -- <unk> that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a world <unk>
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be transmitted by a <unk> idea of birth of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, we were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And by doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what did it happen next?
And women are <unk>
Then this is the success of the Civil Rights Movement with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We find men in the Civil Rights movement saying, "I am a man.
And again, people in the color of the color that we're going to engage with the <unk> <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking questions why we keep certain <unk>
But, attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should be able to combine it to anatomy.
I don't mean that at the age of five years should be allowed to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and I think we should be able to support it.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep any sense.
Well, let's go back to those two beings <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Let's imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before the time, on June 1 1980s.
Henry, on the contrary, born in term: was born on March March of 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary were attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right -- the right to a vote, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that, not because it has a different age, but because it was born later.
We find other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- if it's not told you if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered to be considered to be considered <unk> of the compulsory <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, on his hand, doesn't have the same rights as I Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can get married in all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So still <unk> categories of <unk> that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is: What do we do now that science drives both in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy of <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems like what happens in our culture is kind of a kind of attitude of, "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But many people have stuck in a strange position.
For instance, Texas at a certain time has decided to get married with a man you don't have to have chromosome and you have to get up with a woman you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't do tests <unk> people.
But this is also very strange because of the story that I told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome to <unk>
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his <unk> "I love to <unk> a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks pretty good."
But in practice, how do you do?
How do you judge people based on content in their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we should be able to challenge the rights to the people, because I will admit that I know some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent decisions and <unk> about their sex relationships than people in 40 I know.
So how do you put the theme of content in <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And a part of me wonder what would happen if the character of a person could be measured in the future being measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is going to continue this current of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian where a man who feels attracted to other men is <unk> <unk> unless they are willing to submit to a sex change in which case you can be able to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the one of a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had done a couple of years ago that I had made up to give birth fraternal twins to then pick out their name.
But when the phone asked him the question of the operation -- he was a very <unk> operation -- he said that in that other country -- these kids would be so <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, it's considered political asylum.
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who are without <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we have to be on my head.
Well, to finish that I mean I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given greater participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and it's that I think there can be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about groups.
Since years, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in researching sexual differences.
And one of the things that I've been interested in are differences between men and women in terms of how to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about studying studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
A few years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism feminism was considered to be feminist, like <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what has the female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've heard.
Feminism is going to be able to get rid of <unk> stereotypes -- so there's no female <unk>
But the more I thought about your question, the more I think that there is something that is <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very hard to find the way to protect people from the state, it's possible that there will be more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection from <unk>
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we take the democracy beyond the <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect time, let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where it wants to go to live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now we're far from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count on a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth a lot more than a building cost.
So we could easily go into the world, maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just run by building buildings.
So imagine that half of those who would like to live in apartments already were owners, and that in the other half of them still will get to get it.
They could try to increase the capability of all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas around them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distractions of building them.
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a whole new place, building a whole new apartment building completely new, always and when the rules of that place is going to be building <unk>
So I proposed that governments will grow new areas of reform big enough to contain cities and gave them a name, cities in <unk>
Later I found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 percent will come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask, what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional crisis.
In the following presidential elections -- <unk> we injected together with a platform in which <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a TED talk.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of rules, like those rules that say that you can't go and annoy all the current residents of apartments.
They would take a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of technologies like <unk> <unk> and usually they are the rules that keep us going.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala was sent to <unk> a bond with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than the cost of <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City <unk> which in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion, and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk was describing in very simple terms, that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and an option for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those standards.
So the president of <unk> I was called and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to go and talk about the four and five of January.
So I came up with another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport is covered over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that is measuring at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
All the world <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed <unk>
And this explained to me, that a new city can offer new options.
There would be a choice of a city to which you could go to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away north.
And we also have new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would need help of <unk> countries could benefit from the countries associated with the <unk> countries that would help them to build and make the rules of <unk> so that everybody could trust that <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw one site.
This picture is from there.
It could cover a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, on the 19th of January, they voted at Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that allowed to create these special development regions.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis in Congress in favor of this constitutional constitutional was <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
By <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 of February over the other way in another voting of <unk> to one.
After the voting in the 21st of February, a <unk> delegation of about 30 <unk> went to the two places in the world that are most interested in building in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city which is building in Korea, is larger than the center of Boston.
All that you see there was built in four years after they spent four years getting the <unk>
The other interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this <unk> this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow managers to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allowing its Supreme Court to be the court of the last Supreme Court for this new <unk> system.
There are <unk> <unk> of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've figured out that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies that would like to focus on <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change the other place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to go to get a job work, sometimes are mothers who have to earn money to just eat or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all around the world?
What do you think about insist so that families can choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> asked me to say, "Thank TED TED.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what you are, I'm going to make a <unk> <unk> and it's that I live with <unk>
I love to find, and they recently photograph and photograph on my blog suits, colorful and colorful and different for every time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothing is from the second hand of <unk> markets, and the second hand stores.
Oh, thank you.
The second stores allow me to reduce my <unk> impact on the environment and in my <unk>
I go to know people <unk> usually my money goes to a good <unk> My view is <unk> and buy it becomes my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It's about my size?
I'm going to like color.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are <unk> then I feel like I've won.
To go back to my <unk> I want to tell you what I was doing, for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings someone to you with all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I was coming.
I brought you seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
This is exactly what I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I would like to use after I got here to Palm <unk>
And because you don't know me like the woman walking on the inner clothes,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
While I do, I'm going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure not to use new clothing.
Let's start with the Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see good.
You can almost see <unk> for less than 50 dollars.
All together, including the <unk> took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get away from the right people, not just <unk> you too <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems like I play the <unk> or I remember them in a <unk>
I like to go and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look good at something, it's pretty sure you are.
And if you think you don't see yourself with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person inside your inside and outside, you don't look at <unk>
So there's no excuse for no one in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you. The <unk> <unk> go with it.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a very good way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried over and over again when people were approaching me this week just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I left home, I am going to give it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn about this week is that we have to leave back certain things.
I don't need emotionally emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another suit -- <unk> <unk> and bright <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart, and I came up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive side.
So, if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For instance, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where does your brain look at this scale?
Some of them took a lot of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something like this -- with a big <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
Can you be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum physicists we need to do very logical ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really working.
So how do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We have to play with them and then we see like <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a bit of a intuition that you can have developed over the years is that it says that one thing can be just in one place at a time.
I mean, it might sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you didn't be born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and I didn't do it very well, and it always was <unk>
But I bet you play that bar with that bar to show him a valuable lesson, and it's that big things don't allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a big conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a physicist physicist, because they don't play with parking bars, they play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover they do all kinds of really rare things -- like they can walk through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics a few years ago; you needed from quantum mechanics to describe those small particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because not very often a game with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, never saw a <unk>
But they didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if everything is made of small particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't have been.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why some years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in an <unk> of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green point in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to extend it a little bit. It's just in the center.
And then here we do a good good approach to the little metal <unk>
What we see is a small little bit of metal, so that a springboard and <unk> on a platform.
And so I did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip, and I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a way of swimming swimming on the device.
This device has the capacity to be in a quantum rate, but for that it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am in an elevator right -- I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people go up to do those things, because I don't want to make them <unk> or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The classmates of <unk> objects are not just people, it's also the light that is <unk> and the wind that goes on to the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we'd have to drive all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and pulled the entire air, and then we put it down to an temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just going to be in the <unk> the small piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured their movements.
We found that they moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, I was vibrating. and the way it was <unk> was like a breathing of this shape -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And when you give it a soft <unk> we were able to make it happen, and you can't get it at the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing that is <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all of the trillions of atoms that make up that piece of metal are still down and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all of the metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years -- because, look at this, the difference in scale between one atom and that little bit of metal is roughly the same than the difference between metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why not you too?
I mean, it's my kind of logic that you talk about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body is <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we put it, and we turned the lights and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator actually are just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics -- it claims everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections all around you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another work on Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my head who is here and allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months.
Lots of negotiations and stories, they were <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did it.
I think my own story is explaining just this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> from a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we assembled a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So let me show you a demo to give you a couple of interesting things that we've been doing from their launch.
So, let's go to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite <unk> the New York Museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do that -- very simple.
We click on it, and we are already within the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move out there and they <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the above, and with one click of click, jumped inside.
They're inside, you want to go at the end of the hall,
keep going forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The Vagina <unk> of Pieter <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the picture, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the data of <unk>
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click on here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the technology <unk>
So this picture, for example, I believe, about 10 million pixel languages.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million languages.
It can zoom in around a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to get to <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something going on there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I came up and found that the kids were actually playing on something.
I did a little bit, I talked to some people in the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is hitting a <unk> with a <unk> <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did it, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even more deep in a depth and you'll see that you can actually get into the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to move the image, so you can actually see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, for a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorite, <unk> night here.
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk> work.
It goes up, and it really makes it <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen that before.
I'll show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot more things more here, but I don't have time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich, or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, you walk in, I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we've just made a zooming around around.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Portrait National Gallery.
You can write things up, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my view, even from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice to your artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the big question that you do today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I'm from Italian, every child in Italy grew up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom.
So some time ago, if you wanted to earn a year from Formula 1 would take a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough -- you earned the race.
This is what in engineering, in engineering, in real time system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Today what's interesting is that real control systems are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting computers in the open.
And like <unk> they're starting to respond to different ways and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As I mean, I wanted to mention that cities are just two percent of the cortex of the planet -- but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and even 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our daily objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the late summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms were going back sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the whole interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Michelangelo.
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end he took the hammer and threw it down to this <unk> -- you can actually see a little dent in <unk> and he said, "You know, <unk> <unk> And so what do you not understand?
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> insisting on the idea of getting the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection of the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of you remember it, they played Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day watching activity happens in the network.
Here's the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the Athabasca River.
It's the morning before the game.
The time line is on the top.
By late early on, there are people around here and there are <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people make a quick call and the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk>
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, yeah!
That night they all went to <unk> the center.
You see the big peak.
The next day they all went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time -- people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the heart of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume.
Today, we know everything about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how it was <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed a few small tags to track the trash on its stream.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that in all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a tag on the trash and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're happening very complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that just leaves it didn't think, which is still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle goes down a day still there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is <unk>
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city that came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how do technology, the new technology, join that technology.
And one of the ideas we developed at MIT, in a workshop -- I mean, you have a <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with the pixels of water.
If you get the pixels off the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, images.
And if you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked it.
And I took a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it the <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There are no doors or no windows, but when you get up with it, it opens up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> it goes down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture goes up, and it is just a case.
Those days will always be somebody, in the winter when the roof of the roof, somebody who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you get down almost all the architecture goes away.
This is how it works.
You see the people who are <unk> by what's going on inside.
And here I'm myself trying not to test the sensors that open up the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building, because the way we interact with it had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that opens up to leave you -- but a building that was still making <unk> and water holes, and you had to jump to it not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, designers, we always think about how people will give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air and every one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like what we saw earlier, which is moving with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
And a kind of flexible screen like this with a normal screen in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where it changes is light, not the position of the pixel position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and size, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can get close, and <unk> and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them being controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, from the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dance dancers today, the New York City star and the <unk> <unk> to capture their movement in 3D and use it as input for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> capture it in different <unk>
It's such a 3D <unk> in real time as it capture.
It can change the whole movement.
You can walk all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and motion and motion and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and changed our environment as an oyster nursery like <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is <unk> we can move from the digital world, the self-organizing power of the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may be that we wanted to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how do we move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, <unk>
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud is the pixel in our cloud.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered in the pixel of the pixel of the coral.
You can move along inside, you have different experiences.
You can see it from the bottom, to be able to share the main moments of the Olympics in 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a way of connection to the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can climb up, like a new peak of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but most importantly, it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what they are?
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, you might improve <unk> for more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you might want to be more strong, to be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and sure of themselves?
How about living on good health?
Or maybe they're from those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is it that most of them are going to do?"
What would you like if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people are <unk> creativity?
Hands up. Let me see.
<unk> -- probably the number of creative creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would they choose memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Ah, most of us, that makes me feel very good as a doctor.
If you could have something about this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference, but today I want to give you a physician look on the subject.
The big billionth of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the church Church of <unk> <unk> wrote a trial called <unk> <unk> in biology -- makes sense for the light of <unk>
But if they effectively embrace biological evolution, consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
It refers to the others or to us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end is, of course, that we're most interested in interested.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
There have been maybe 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem to be very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, mostly the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human insulin which is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, which is <unk> that comes out of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry up in the more bacteria than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio <unk> asked them about the <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully adaptive environment for those bacteria.
It's dark, dark, vertical, is very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want to want no effort to be able to want no effort to it.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush rush of the output.
But so, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients to us and protect us from certain diseases.
But what do we tell us?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant it to become something different, something maybe better adapted to <unk>
In this vast <unk> <unk> of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single <unk> and human life, a small note.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I just went to college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in organisms <unk> each cell is just divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two bacterial cells.
But when the organisms come up, things start to change.
It enters the sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that goes through the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of death in the body comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year he was happening, every time I was happening, I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits your hotel door <unk>
He opens the door.
In front of him there is a small dancer <unk>
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He said, "It's like, "I would choose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to get healthy.
I wanted to recover the health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and healthier.
Evolution is to pass the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> which is designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us drop the sea.
I think all of the <unk> the feeling that he expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my job.
I want to give you <unk> not <unk>
Evolution does not necessarily inspire longevity.
It doesn't necessarily do it for the biggest or the strongest or the faster or the faster or even the smartest one.
Evolution matched the best creatures to <unk> their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish <unk> the vacuum, but they've managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean -- when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we come back to think about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look ahead at the <unk> phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and cut out of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that we adapt to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, we <unk> <unk> and <unk> so much that it is no longer possible to have the necessary isolation that we have in evolution.
A second possibility is that you make an evolution of the natural, naturally dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears here would be: that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as we <unk> when as a <unk> planets are going to exist there and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there's a third possibility, one possible possibility.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and <unk> for us as a individuals in the decisions that we get.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
So first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what you choose to do is <unk> and familiar.
So think that if it might be possible to be able to choose not only sex from their <unk> but in your own body to make genetic settings to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If you look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started 1990, and he saved 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
In the next year of course, in 2004, I could get the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost close to 20,000 and a week.
We don't have a lot to do the human genome for <unk> and being more and more to the grasp of all.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect themselves but they are going to induce immunity.
<unk> or there's no experimental trials in the course with the flu vaccine in the <unk> <unk> cells.
Can you imagine something good about <unk>
That is actually today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then, just two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies, but if you can change the cells of their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or to change the <unk> <unk> and giving their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating your diabetes, remove the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want any more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology that can produce the changes of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases will also allow us to embrace <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of an <unk> <unk> especially if you could go to the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can embrace the attributes we wanted to have turned to the evolution of the <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally take 100,000 years and we can go to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next hundred years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these options on a better, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to choose a different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most profound of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom required to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for bad, and before what I could do -- these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 3,000 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a unique seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk about with the flight flight.
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had been <unk> and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot is putting the plane on the Hudson River.
Often that's not the way.
It would take the motors.
Imagine being on a plane and <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three words I have heard of.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight worker.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before you die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to do, and I didn't do that, all the fences that I wanted <unk> all the experiences that I have wanted to have and never do it.
As I was thinking about that further, I got a sentence, which is <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to know anything in life.
And that urgency, that is really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as the bridge -- George Washington, which was not a lot -- I thought about, Whoa! I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and with my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity as I also gave my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I would focus on things that didn't matter with people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, like <unk> on that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have reason -- <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is going to be <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
Am I saying, "Please do it."
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And while <unk> I had the sense of, Wow, it's not afraid of fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that our whole life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids growing.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --   And I scream, <unk> like a small kid.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
At that point, I got to connect those two points -- that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was <unk> a miracle of not dying that day.
And I was told by the other gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and come back and live differently.
You guys are flying today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens on your plane -- and please not be that -- but you can imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is it that you think that they still expect to do because they think they're going to be <unk>
How would your relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the greatest thing that I worked on was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came to her home after he was running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Now, <unk> has total paralysis
It can only use your eyes.
Their work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that, obviously, graffiti is something intricate that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with her brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with it, and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> it's not that all people who can paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody important, and you have a good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Would anybody seen the film <unk> and <unk>
They communicate in that way, they're marking up with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I came up with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that he signed a check, I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I stayed with her brother and her father there at the right time, "OK, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous to be so ridiculous that somebody who have so much inside their own can't <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research -- that have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser, you draw on that and you have a laser pointer.
So they go around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a cycle of life.
They first start with sex organs, then with the bad words, after the attacks of <unk> and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life in his <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and so much to move things out of one side to another one we had a couple of things.
One, touch on the doors of business companies and we got a machine for you to <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And really, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from it, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all around the world in all the corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids, and I moved to the garage and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> they took the control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we did something completely stupid and when they were <unk> they would have taken away the frames of the walls and in its place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> walk my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of cheap sun sunglasses that we buy on the <unk> walk on <unk> Beach, some copper wire and things out of Home <unk> and Radio <unk>
We took a <unk> camera, we put it together on a light light, and now there's a device that's free -- that is free -- we published the code -- we published the code, we published the software <unk>
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says, "No."
There's no hospital that can say that?
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this picture is the other person and that's his room.
There were all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a planning year, two weeks of teaching from all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the outside of the outside of the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of her family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take on the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what was like, "This was the first time I was a <unk> I was in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and take me out there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us on motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device, but it's the equivalent of an open-source <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to do it and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The awards was the <unk> "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the top 50 inventions in 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up close to the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of <unk> in the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty awesome.
So basically this is my idea: If you see something that is not possible, do it possible.
Nothing you have in this room was possible -- the computer -- the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with speech recognition, I just recognized something and <unk> me with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find something that we feel like to do. If it's not now <unk> And if I'm not myself, who?
Thank you guys.
I have spent the last few years in situations in situations generally very difficult and at the same time as dangerous as well.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
It's in <unk> in <unk> and difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just this funny fun at first, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I've been amazed in situations where horrible things with the only goal to treat.
So when I knew that I would come here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard of it, or not, a couple weeks ago I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some text messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered the rights of my <unk> <unk>
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TED Talk that you have no idea what it is about and content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But I said that, it's a very good chance.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago I could not have any chance for certain.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we tested the world marketing world.
And as I said earlier, I've gotten into horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could <unk> it to something as difficult or as dangerous as you go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that I tried to try to do a <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that all of the film is <unk> with products and marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call the largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that everything from top to the bottom, first at end, has a brand images of brand, all the time from the <unk> that appears before the title, the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> at <unk> forever.
And so the film is exploring this whole idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's what? It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk> He was <unk>
He was <unk> forever."
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X mark on the title but we're going to make sure we burn all the categories that we can on the film.
Maybe you get a shoe, and it becomes the coolest shoe you get.
The greatest car you have driven in "The largest movie ever <unk> the best drink that you have <unk> <unk> from "The <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is so in addition to showing brands as part of life, making them <unk> <unk> <unk> to cause the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The <unk> goal is transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the whole idea of it, all the film of beginning to end.
And I would love to help you make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people to that.
<unk> Do you have a <unk> -- I don't know if <unk> is too <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> David <unk> David <unk> How much money do you need to do this?
MS: One and a half million and a half -- <unk> -- John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to go to the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie is going to look at us like a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be difficult for the film or to be I?
JK:
MS: <unk> means you're not really optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yes. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where they go. <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation <unk>
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all of these companies suddenly disappear.
None of them wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, it was to take the product to as many people as possible as possible, so that many people would see it as possible.
Especially in the world today is this intersection of new media and old media and the <unk> stage -- is not the idea of that idea of that new vehicle that is going to bring the message to <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, that my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this one.
Actually, no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>     -- this is one of the first images that showed up.
I like a way of <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by visibility or information; of information, especially the last line perhaps the greatest line.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president of the <unk> even the <unk> <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to how it comes to it really changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency day <unk>  like that weird bear that still keeps <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is <unk>
They had a <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want them to be <unk> history.
We want you to make a story, but we want to be <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and there he is looking at me, as I used to say, <unk> there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the real."
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the actual story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> from many years -- I realized I would have to go on my own, I would have to get to <unk> and go to the companies myself with all my team.
So what I started trying to figure out what I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, huge movies, and others who make small, independent movies like mine.
And my friends who make films of big Hollywood movies say that the reason their movies are so successful is because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who do independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest movie ever <unk>
How are we going to look specifically at the movie?
Every time I'm walking out every time I open my <unk> you see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with somebody I can say, "You're cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want you to let me get you.
Maybe you need to put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there it took one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man like <unk> solid, <unk> <unk> on a bar, like it.
That's the big look at it.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
It would look at the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> are more than a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, reminding people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category at positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do we keep you fresh, <unk> more <unk> more <unk> three times more <unk>
Things like those <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a company <unk>
What about me? What about a common kind of <unk>
I need to talk to the man of the street, to people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do they define you your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like <unk>
Woman: Let's bring the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like dark colors, and many gray colors and things like this.
And they usually wear yourself like sunglasses, or <unk> or similar <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand -- it could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman #2: In part sort of hippie part of <unk> in part <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of the pet guy.
They build toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx out because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk> <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be <unk> but I often focus on the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that brand of <unk>
If they could do it for them, you can surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a familiar picture.
A little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings and feelings of it.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: <unk>
MS: That world? I think that your world is the world in which we are going to be around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come up and start in a place and in my case come up and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about?
MS: The next one is the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be myself.
I like things different.
I like the weird things, I like things like this.
A: <unk>
What's the <unk> Where phase of <unk> you find is now?
Why is it important?
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more than you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
I don't have to be scary. What kind of Russian rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience. Great <unk> Yes. Yes.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot of madness to all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides, but <unk> in your personality -- <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They got very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think that some companies will only be engaged in one of your strong points or in the other rather rather than focus on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's nature to avoid the things that they're not <unk> to avoid fear, those elements -- and you actually make them sink and make it become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are that?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> and brands -- all those things that have gone and come up with it, but a <unk> brand is something pretty powerful.
MS:
If somebody asks you to take your identity and a brand, you know, what would be?
You're a logarithmic attribute -- you're somebody who makes the blood <unk>
Or are you more well a attribute <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful to be cool like <unk> contemporary -- <unk> <unk> or bold as a <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or mystic -- like <unk>
Or are you more than attribute <unk>
You're aware, sophisticated as <unk>
You're a <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're reliable -- stable, familiar, safe, sacred, <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they would have no control on the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how they're now using magnetic resonance to identify the <unk> centers in the brain as well as a movie marketing centers.
We went to San Paulo where it's banned advertising in the open.
All over the city for the last five years there is no <unk> there's no <unk> there is no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting a path in schools with money problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects in which I've had the greatest answer or the ones that I have more successful are those people I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They took the <unk> they took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with an artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to challenge people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? They success?
Well, since the film was released in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
And by <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is just just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, nor TV either.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It hasn't even been introduced in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already started to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all the agencies that we talked about is giving their clients not to be part.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks are opportunities.
I think when you get out of that when you get out of that, they're pushing them up to failure.
I think that when you train their employees to <unk> your risk is preparing their entire company to be <unk>
I feel like what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people who don't have the fear of the opportunities they can <unk>
Ultimately, we're going to move forward, I think we have to get to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. Look at the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
More than never a little honesty is going to run a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk -- <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So I would focus on the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED matrix and the <unk> Foundation for <unk> to be applied to my own TED <unk>
The idea behind the Gordian worm <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we can compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software is a completely different technology.
But if we can put a cash virus from Windows in a portable computer used by an engineer to set up this gray, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray box <unk> the <unk> and the nuclear nuclear program is <unk> <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of the <unk> the <unk> used multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed like to want to do something with these exotic boxes -- these control systems.
That would be the attention, and we started an experiment in which we had <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So there were very odd things.
<unk> <unk> like a laboratory rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after I experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack?
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking at actively in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that's trying to infect is effectively working on that place:
If not, they don't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's <unk>
It might be, let's say for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
They're better than they would take your goal.
And so we pulled out and push the attack, and we found out that it was <unk> on two bombs -- a small little bit and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally <unk> by people who obviously had all the internal information.
They were all going to attack.
And you probably even know how much they did the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high-tech and <unk> let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find this code.
What we were looking at at first were called the system of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and we were trying to adapt it with the real world, with potential real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> white and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections are <unk>
They don't meet several thousand goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant of <unk>
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and the power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I met them in an effort by <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
rotor is that small part within the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can be <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking at the data and its structures.
So for instance, the number of <unk> <unk> on that code, you can't <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk>
That makes sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better than that.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gives us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had with each other.
It wasn't <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been away after several weeks of hard work.
They were <unk> in dead ends, and we had to go back again.
And yet, we found out that both digital <unk> would be on the same and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making these <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating it.
In <unk> we're very comfortable in which we have determined that we have given the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We shouldn't worry that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we saw, I really looked at me.
There's the gray box -- and the top is <unk>
What this thing does is intercept the input input values for example, of pressure sensors and the sensors of vibration and provides <unk> code, which still runs during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's kind of like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is fed up <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not perform fast.
For instance, in an energy plant, when the big turbine turbine goes on of the speed of <unk> you have to open tubes in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator,
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then they can pass bad things.
The plant can explode.
And I don't know the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a energy plant, or in a car factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have any <unk> to disseminate this burden with a key key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of tube <unk>
It would be more likely as possible.
And if you made that, you know, with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we have to face.
Unfortunately, the number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with great number of goals.
We have to face the consequences and better than we start making it now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk>
There's one alone, and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be older yet.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take it, and that give you <unk> skills, or another one that makes users come up and get back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that you put in the morning, it gives you a great force -- that you can also increase its speed, and help you, for example, how to drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate and connect it with the universe and with other intractable things.
This is not an idea.
To show you now in what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, must take on their back a <unk> load of <unk> and it's <unk> to get even more team.
Obviously this leads to some major complications in the back, in the back of the back, at 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage of back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help to handle the issue.
Let me introduce you to <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Universal <unk>
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton I can take it up 90 pounds by variables for many hours.
Your flexible design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running <unk> movement.
I want to make sure what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We are ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the user users of the <unk> about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people, roughly, in the <unk> around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens to a very young people, very young people, with damage to the spinal cord that when you start their life -- 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that is <unk> fast.
Their only choice, many times -- for a brain injury, or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I have to recognize.
So we decided to start to write a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago in the neocortical column, and as a result he couldn't walk over 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got sensors on it.
It's completely not going to lie in crutches, they send signals to on board, here on the back.
There are also a few batteries that give power to the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it move forward with this kind of very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life, when, for a strange leap in the air, skiing down the bottom remained <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost feeling and all the movement on the bottom.
Shortly after that, a doctor went into my bedroom in the hospital, and he said, "You will never go to <unk>
That was about 19 years ago.
So I stole up to the last bit of hope of my self.
The technology of adaptation since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs up in <unk> climbing rocks and even ride on a bicycle <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the life of future generations -- not just of soldiers, but Amanda, and all the user users of the wheels, everybody.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet their cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos of the Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimps, their closest kin.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot of emphasis on this look at our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos will show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by large, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a remarkably tolerant society, where the mortal violence has not been <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest <unk> and it's been very hard to get.
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage stage of a violent conflict that has been given, for decades, and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's no wonder that this destruction is also putting the survival of the Bonobo.
The flesh of <unk> and deforestation do you can't fill in a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not safe about it.
However, on this land of violence and chaos you can hear the hidden laughter, the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like <unk> apes love, not the <unk> because they have sex and <unk> and <unk> to handle conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of mankind because the life of Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a children's game.
For us, and for them the game is fundamental to establish ties and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and learn the rules of the game.
Play increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behavior, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo you see the roots of the same <unk> of laughter and the dance and the human story.
Play is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> ball game, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "It has a <unk> of the <unk>
I just think that in this case to him, I love it, right?
Yes.
So the sexual play is common as much in Bonobos as humans.
And this video is really interesting because it <unk> this video really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements in the game -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
Play is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with <unk> water.
I think that we do sometimes play ourselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the actual <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world and more difficult cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, play is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's get to the peak of our game ability.
Play is not <unk>
Play is essential.
For bonobos and human <unk> life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least appropriate play, it can be the most urgent time.
So peers primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as it <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, I grew up fires like a captain of captain on a farm body.
And in our city, where the volunteers allies in a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a career standing against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and find out what our task was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that surely went through one of the worst days of life.
We were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had had just gotten before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  came up to the captain to the captain and she asked him to walk up and would save the <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell people who entered a <unk> building to save an age of being alive just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need you to get to the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a couple of shoes."
I promise you.
It wasn't exactly what I was waiting for, but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the fire department -- that at that height or less they had just finished off the fire and went into the front room looking for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the precious dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house in the house for the owner of home where, as he was expected, his treasure. got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the owner of the owner of the house by the courageous <unk> to save her house.
The kindness that she looked at over the other was that somebody had reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like in my calling as a voluntary fireman is a witness of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of the <unk> and courage to individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
It all has their importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have been achieved, or they are to have a really remarkable level of success I'd like to remind you to remind you.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give you a giving, <unk> now.
They took food in a dining room, they would put a neighborhood park.
Be mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the chance to save someone else's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So you trained the <unk> <unk> shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the particular block of paper.
The first concrete blocks are built in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules of cement of a fixed measure that fit into each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They've allowed us to build bigger things than us, as buildings, or bridges a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
He was called the <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's been estimated that they've been made over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be engineer to build beautiful bridges or buildings or houses.
He made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the concrete block to the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a <unk> <unk> world, piled on a world to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block that the transistor allows you to create much greater and more complex, a brick at the time.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was just to experts.
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are being reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they come together with magnets.
So you can't be able to be wrong.
<unk> have a code of color.
The green is the road, the blue is the stream, the rose is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble one blue one in the green and very quickly you can begin to make greater circuits.
One blue one is a green one make light.
Can we put a <unk> button and we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse, that's here, and now we have a light <unk>
We put this <unk> to create more impact, and we have a computer machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program and connect and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make it <unk> faster, you just turn this button to make the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a huge collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to put it into bricks and used to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given <unk> to kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light of night, or why the door of an elevator is kept open and how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for instance, designers without any experience in electronics start playing with <unk> like a material.
You can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> --  A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers of the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, which has no experience in engineering, just in wood and paper and we said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that has done a <unk> cannon canyon in motion.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be in the grasp of all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, you can download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world is ours.
So go ahead and make up.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking to get involved with the environment.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
Take a minute.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Solar is ...
Oh, I know the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represent almost everything you're supposed to be, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like some Peace <unk>
We took some members every year and we put them together with <unk>
Instead of sending them to Third World we send them into wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with the employees <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
It is a hydrant from the city of Boston.
So here it appears to be a date, but what you really look for is that somebody is being caught by when it is stuck by snow because it knows it's not very good to cook fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help in this way <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of members for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment I was going to spend a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens will be <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case he put <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can be <unk>
I mean, it has a component component.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 apps <unk> last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it extends into viral form.
A responsible for systems of <unk> City, by seeing this app realized that I could use it, not for snow, but for the citizens to have <unk> <unk>
It's very important that they work with these <unk> of tsunami, but people <unk> the batteries.
So it asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago, just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that will use using it.
And this has been spread out of <unk> organic and natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know this doesn't happen.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that they had done for normal channels that would have taken at least two years and screen about two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project in the California California project that even the time has two million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that you program in a couple of days and it is <unk> on viral form is a kind of shoot warning about the government of government.
It suggests to the best ways to work, not like private enterprises, as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but more well as the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents how we address the question of government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution, but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools for them to deal with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to an app in their own communities.
You haven't given up with government.
Do you feel a great frustration in front of that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something we've lost from sight.
And that is that if we left the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that make us insane, the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> which we do together because we don't have any <unk>
Now, many people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The policy is not <unk> the government yes.
And because the government ultimately made out of us -- you remember that <unk> <unk> the way that we think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, above all, a matter of <unk>
This is the center of medical care and information.
It's the place that calls calls if you brand <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this phone call.
He checked <unk> at the basis of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the door of your house, put it very strong and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So well for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a center center.
It has a <unk> and mobile phone called <unk> <unk>
It doesn't <unk> that app.
It was the work of very clever people in the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this is actually coming up with this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it for <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so you can all see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I approached the place, I found the garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical.
And it's also a great example of the government of government to volunteer a distributed company.
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to <unk> and help others.
So a citizen helped another but here the government had a key thing.
I connected to the two people.
And it could have been connected with the government services, but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When a neighbor helps another neighbor to go to another, <unk> the communities.
If we call the animals, it costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that you're the input of the other.
That our entry into the government system is the vote.
How many times have they chosen a political <unk> We sometimes spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that government will expand our values and <unk> our needs but then we don't see change.
That's because government is like an immense ocean and politics is the shallow <unk> layer.
So underneath it is what we call <unk>
And we said that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> what keeps us that is that we have this thing that we had to financed as something that we operate in our against, that something else, and in a consequence we're missing power.
People believe politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work we will have to make that bureaucracy it is sexy.
Because that's where the real work of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They've been <unk>
It's a group of citizens worried that they've written a very detailed report on instant feedback pages in response to the request of <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That is not a political activism that is <unk>
And for the ones that we have <unk> ourselves in the government, is time that we asked what world we want to leave to our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face.
Do you really think that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act <unk>
We can't do without government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the government of government so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet, and it knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> we only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of age is 28 years old, so I am an older generation than a lot of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face on who is going to be <unk> they're all going to speak.
They can express their views on any channel, at the same time and they do.
So when you face the problem of government they don't care about to make your voices.
They're using your hands.
They bring hands to the work to program apps that make it better for government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking out by pulling out a trash cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and many people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumer consumers -- we're not only consumer consumers and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask you all of all of you, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row, in death row, in death row, I've spent the death of death.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here is a impact around the world.
On occasion, if something comes from TED, it makes a sense and a force that wouldn't have any other way.
I think this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we saw fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a professor can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't learn this in the practice of the law, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in every discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in <unk> Virginia on <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was little, I would look at it, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
It was so hard I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I would come back to <unk> and he said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him that I was going to get it out of it, and if I said that yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least of the 10.
On occasion, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture their time and his attention.
My cousins were running around.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I went to the room and there were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I thought it was a game.
So I looked at it, and she was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up, I went up, went through the room, and he took me out of the room, and he said, "Come on, <unk> The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't know it, I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you do?"
I will never forget.
Then he said to me, "Just want me to give you three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me is that you always want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that I always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell me is that you're always going to be doing the right thing -- even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought it and I said, "Yes, <unk> So, <unk>
And then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that you will never get <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in rural South, I have a brother a year older than a year and a little sister.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package -- I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and I went to the forest.
We just got to doing the <unk> of the time.
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right, you know, but I'm not going to take a <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> And you always do the same thing as we do.
I took something, your sister also took a <unk>
I said, "No, I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
And I walked up with the force and <unk> "Oh, it's not that you're still thinking about conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren who are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this to spread <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I'm saying it by the power that it has identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that really doesn't make any sense.
We can't get to do things that don't think they can do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of <unk> diseases of <unk>
And these were the things that, according to it, we had <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There's 2.3 million.
In America we have the highest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive <unk> in my view, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities, or black, you find so much <unk> so much of these facts.
One of the three black men between 18 and 30 years is in prison or in a parole.
In urban <unk> around the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore -- Washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all the young people in the color in prison or in probation.
Our system is not just distorted versus race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that tries much better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> but wealth is what happens to the results.
And it seems like we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger make us believe that these are not ours.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We are looking at our work some good developments quite curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as other states, you know about rights because you've got a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we put it back to the next 10 years the loss of rights will be as high as it was before we put the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
America is the only country in the world in the world of 13 years to die in prison.
We have this country prison for children, no chance to go out there.
Right now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in death row.
This issue of death penalty issue is interesting.
In a sense, we have moved to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not trying to decide whether people deserve to die for the <unk> crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty death penalty is defined by error.
From every nine people who have identified that it's innocent that it's <unk> and liberated from death row, of death.
An innocent rate -- <unk> an innocent <unk>
This is interesting.
In aviation would not be allowed to be able to be able to fly airplanes, if every nine you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue that if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classroom with students in history -- I talk about slavery to you.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time that it started at the end of the reconstruction of the reconstruction and it lasted up to World War II.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined his lives.
There are now older people who come up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you're teaching talks, you know, <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history of the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They asked me to say, "No. Say that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of cook and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like talking about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood what we've been done.
All of the time I was doing with each other.
We are constantly creating tensions and conflict.
It costs us work talking about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome <unk> <unk> without a engagement with truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide they had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death penalty <unk>
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "You know it's good worrying to listen to what you want.
<unk> "We don't have a death penalty <unk>
We will never be able to be here."
The room was silent and a lady said, "There's no way that with our story, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> <unk> and <unk> us to run people."
And I think about this.
How would we feel like in a world where a nation like Germany, and we would be people, especially if they were in their majority of <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you actually don't care about these things so hard -- the positive and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are really fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, abuse, <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both of those.
Recently we talk about the need to get more hope, more commitment, more than the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> the ones that never come to TED.
And if you think about them it is, in a way, something that's within our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen before.
So we are, despite being so rational, so committed to the intellectual <unk>
With innovation, with creativity, development comes out not just brain ideas.
These things come from ideas <unk> also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, counseling for the spirit, an will to be in sites of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think that even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There's no related disconnect with technology and design, that allowed us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to the <unk> to inequality, to inequality, to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer from meeting Rosa <unk>
These women were just gathered together to speak.
Occasionally, the lady was called to me -- to say, <unk> is the old lady -- we're going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and go <unk>
I was like, "Be lady. I do."
So she would say, "Well, what are you going to do when she <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was going to go and just <unk>
It was a very powerful thing.
And at one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Mrs. Parks went on to me and said, "Now, how do you think about it that idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We tried to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We tried to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We tried to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom for children.
We tried to do something about the death penalty thing.
We try to reduce the population on prison.
We tried to end the <unk> <unk>
And I gave all my best speech, and I looked at me and he said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> exhausted, very <unk>
At that moment, Ms. <unk> <unk> me on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to figure out how to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been doing simple things.
I have come to understand and to believe that each one of us is higher to the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't play, it's not a <unk>
Even if somebody kills each other, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there is a basic dignity in people who must be <unk> by law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and, certainly, in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
It's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> not judging by our technology, because of our intellectual ability or rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not the way they deal with the rich and <unk> and <unk> but the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to go to prison and I see my <unk> clients and 14 years, who have been <unk> so that they were <unk> as adults themselves.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to somebody in which it isn't it?
The judge is <unk> as an adult, but I see a boy.
And one night I was very late was awake -- my God, if the judge can become something that you don't are, you must have magical powers.
Yeah, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was too late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14-year-old client -- a small, black.
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my <unk> black client is treated as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> I put there had been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical but an entire lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking about that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or actually <unk>
For my horror, not only he had <unk> but I had sent the cut.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> God. God, I have to go in the court for this case stupid.
I got into the car and I really felt <unk>
I was in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got down the car. He walked to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found a black man <unk> was the <unk> of the court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
And then I approached my feet to me.
And I got rid of the ear, you know.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
It connected deeply with my interior, with my identity with the capacity that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the hunting room.
By coming in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk>
People started to get there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They came the cops the prosecutors <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly without knowing how, the room was full of people. All fluctuations because we talked about races, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I went to see the <unk> who went and <unk>
He looked out of the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
You can walk around here and over here.
Finally, this old black, with a face of concern, walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge, the judge was <unk>
During the break a <unk> he was upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant ran over the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up, I looked at the <unk> I looked at me and he said, <unk> to this young audiences to tell this young man to keep her view in the target with <unk>
I have come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds to justice.
We can't truly be human, if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is tied up with each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you here who share this, I just want to tell you to keep the view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious one, I wish the audience of the audience, in this community, to help you do something.
Something that is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California -- for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you will make an effort to improve the funds that they spend today in terms of punishment.
For instance, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death penalty in the next five years. A billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the homicide cases was not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes doesn't get anything.
Here's an opportunity to change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funding to make the law law, to security.
I think there is a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Some of the explanation, is that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who believe it is?
<unk> actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in massive <unk> in this country is not about crimes with violence.
It's about the wrong War on drugs.
That's why it comes to this dramatic rise in the population of <unk>
And we let us convince ourselves for the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes in order to bring people into a chain of <unk> to steal a bicycle by small crimes against property instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you excited to get us excited about this here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> This is just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- could be the last six years or the last six years or the last six years.
The idea is that the media is rather than the media -- rather negative news because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are getting a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters more than survive, the first stop all of those data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early.
<unk> and records all the information searching for something in the environment that could hurt us.
So for a <unk> of stories, <unk> look at the negative.
That old saying of <unk> "If there is blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices provide us negative news about seven days of a week, 24 hours a day, no wonder that we're <unk>
It's no surprise that people think that the world will go wrong in worse.
But maybe it's not like that.
Perhaps instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, the scale of species, the shortage of water and <unk> without aware of them.
As human beings, we are very good at <unk> the problems, and in the long time, we ended up with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> average per capita income for inflation has <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of electricity, transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy went from 25 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary age.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to raise more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, heavy television, mobile television, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
We have a lot of this this is technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we put in technology technology runs on this curve, Moore's Law and doubling the price of the price at about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad time in war and peace, in peace and <unk>
It's the result of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop with any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> Law Law is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
<unk> in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computing and sensors and networks, robotics, 3D printing and its capacity to democratize and distribute it personalized production throughout the planet, biology and digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk> and the digital drug, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I went looking at the newspapers the best headline you <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's not an easy game.
Play with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all on the cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be able to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or a service, which can be positive affect the lives of one decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students might be able to impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a hundred companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create life <unk> for every single day on the planet, it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking this little bit of <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
We went to dinner the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon ate out of silver, and the same <unk> with <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, was much more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington Monument, the aluminum is aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal set.
It's tied up with oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and made from aluminum something so cheap that we used it as if it was <unk>
We have this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on an Earth-like planet for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 percent of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about raw but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the wars for the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan has pointed the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, in 1990, that happened <unk>
You know, a famous picture of it. How would you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk> point.
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yeah, <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the water <unk> but also there is a hope.
It's a technology available in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, I gave me permission to show you your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small refrigerator long.
It is able to generate a thousand gallons of drinking water on the day of any water source, saltwater, water, water <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coke just thought that I will make a major test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have full confidence in which I will be, Coca-Cola is going to be built in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an inclusive innovation for this technology that today exists.
And we've seen it in cell phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
And we had that beautiful warrior -- it has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to have a smartphone with a smartphone with more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
He lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid for tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> images, images, and music libraries -- now <unk> and they lose value value with cell phones.
Maybe the best thing to get when it comes to the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is something called the X <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies in a mobile device with which they talk, and because it has <unk> they can be extracted from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics that have a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no physicians, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a sound of RNA or DNA that we can't call the <unk> and first of all, to prevent the pandemic happened.
But this is the greatest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the billion increasing.
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the brand of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we will go from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion of our minds have never been going up to the global conversation.
What will these people?
What do you want? What wishes <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillion dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> more health from the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy of <unk> and because of the use of impressions in 3D and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide 3,000 million more members of mankind, healthy educated and <unk>
How about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give the defenseless, wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and we could act for the first time?
What about these 3,000 billion?
And if they are contributions we can't afford it.
One thing that I learned with the X X is that small teams guided by their passion with a goal, of course, can do things like <unk> things that were only able to make the great corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up with sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you already know.
It's called <unk>
They lie at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> determine structure and functionality.
It's something very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this university teachers between others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people went around and started <unk>
And it's been shown that today the pattern of human patterns recognition is better proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me an enormous confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the great passion for <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are <unk> to work on the solution of great challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of some extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The <unk> of the <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it didn't.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was <unk>
He was caught up to the <unk>
Now the fish is on the Red Cross of <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come in the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a pond, in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I was burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, <unk>
I had <unk> from about 20 millimeters a black beard <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good time, so I became more than a half in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later the amount of fish had dropped to half.
I went back to the five inches.
It takes a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of fishing <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- <unk> started in <unk> Europe, did a lot of development.
The fishing development meant to impose the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty ugly, <unk> <unk>
I went down to fish in it, and we did studies in the southern Sea of the South China Sea, and above all, in the Beaufort Sea, and above all, in the Sargasso Sea, and above all, in the Beaufort Sea.
What we capture was something <unk>
<unk> now I know the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the bottom.
And most fish are blobs of fish on a little bit about <unk> these are fish from coral reef.
In short, the sea floor came to the cover and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a studio and then you start the commercial fishing.
The bottom of being a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk>
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to be <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect the fishermen every time they go to an area where you have never fish fish.
But it's not <unk>
We don't remember it.
Let's get the starting point to start on the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
So on the Y-axis, we have things that are <unk> biodiversity, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use images to use the images in the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive loss that happened before.
You can analyze the kind of changes.
And at the end of the end of the <unk> remains.
And that is very much what we want to do now.
We want to keep things that no longer they are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies kill them, kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal which is very plentiful, before <unk> is uncommon.
You don't lose animals.
You lose hot animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea synonymous with big fish.
They become rare because <unk>
You have a few fish, but we think that that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because evidence presented in an earlier way, is not the way they would expect that to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of them would like me as a captain that is a captain who would find a lot of fish in this area can't be used, or usually not using the media scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies because they don't trust the sources of the past.
From the huge role that it can be a protected marine area.
Because with the marine protected areas, we really <unk> the past.
So we have the past that people can't think about because the point of starting is run and extremely low.
That is for people who can see a marine protected marine protected area and they can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people in the Midwest, for example?
I think there the arts and cinema may be able to fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay.
And you have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think why people were moved with the film, talking about the story of <unk> why <unk> with <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is to Cameron, to make them <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and look at YouTube videos.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why the videos are causing the viral and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed a very, very difficult thing.
But today, the video video makes any of us, or our stock, copper in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can have famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They climb over 48 hours of video on YouTube per minute.
And of those, just a small percentage makes a infinite result of <unk> and it makes a cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: I creators <unk> communities and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God, my God.
My God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this shot outside of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows up in the rise of popularity of the summer summer.
<unk> was not saying a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double bow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had been published many of the videos.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this mindset that would send the video to the popular.
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> present new things and interesting things to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start on Friday.   You all want to get on the end of a week, the weekend on a week.   <unk> Friday. You know, on Friday.  KA: Don't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> from Black Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This chart shows the frequency of use.
And just like <unk> -- I would look like this video seemed to come out of nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday in <unk>
Well, it took <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke on Twitter on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of trends take up a point of view, and they share it with a larger audience speed the process.
So, this one community of people who shares this big joke and then starts talking about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
So just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century, this community engagement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation with a <unk> music.
That's the case.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that that's a little bit of three hours that has been seen about four million times.
And even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats saw the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that woke up between the Internet community of the Internet.
There was <unk>
Someone did one version of the old one.
And then international international did.
All of a sudden, came up with a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all be <unk>
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> Are you <unk> or 400,000 <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What could script might be written by this situation?
In a world where two days of video is going up in a minute, only that truly unique and unexpected can be <unk> the way these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great clip of a guy who protest against <unk> in New York, in New York, I admit to not really interested in too much.
Casey <unk> They spread me down for <unk> but often there are obstacles that keep you circulate properly for the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise and your humor, Casey <unk> achieved that five million you saw and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new thing we do in creative form.
And all of this leads us to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of <unk> creative communities for participation, totally unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- a new culture, that we all have access to and is the audience that defines the popular.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrity in the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
You don't get permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all kind of masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's just the means of the current means but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supportive of the one and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
So the words, for so long, friends, now I do it."
They were <unk>
He died <unk>
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to be treated but I <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn at dawn <unk>
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when her father died, and marriage marriage, and two small girls.
For her, life was going to be meant to an <unk> task for her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her who couldn't do that.
And after a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat slid into the sea dressed of vessel.
All adults knew the risks.
The most fear was the hacks, rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a poison.
If we first started, we would take it out, my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, <unk> <unk> on each wave, and the vast horizon.
I don't remember the hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the engine was dying and not being able to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights on the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, I would end up on the trip was too much for it; and the first apple I had, given through the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor of it.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations giving way to a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> <unk> whose population is made of immigrants from immigrant
Unlike the middle class <unk> whose existence would be <unk> in <unk> no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the shops were the rest of the world.
And the English fragments are <unk> between people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, and then in a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in I.T. <unk> of <unk>
We were poor.
And all of the dollars were <unk> and they set up an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, would not matter what it was like <unk> that I was usually clothes, who was always <unk>
Two base pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform up to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
home.
Something in me was <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I was sitting in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were terrified of our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the boat.
And my task was to be wakes up until his nightmares started to be able to be able to get it back.
She opened a computer store, then studied to be <unk> and she opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition and angry and <unk> and <unk> boys caught between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, I was the classic <unk> relentless <unk> with what I <unk> of myself.
On the other one, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically killed by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many of them received it through the years.
And for that work, when I studied my last year of a year, I was elected the young Australian boy of the year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges didn't <unk>
So I <unk> <unk> anonymously was now as <unk> refugee and social activist -- invited to speak in places that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence would never possibly imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the happy life in a <unk> suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for nearly 20 years old, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I was now the same age that she had when she got into the boat.
Neither had ever been an option.
He said to me, and they don't be what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> to the marginalized and <unk>
And the more frankly I knew, the more it was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the roads in life, a lot of them doing what they were doing, living on the boundary of possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stand in a career of a lawyer.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be an unknown one, new in the scene -- and not only is good, but it's something that is being grateful, maybe a boat.
Because being inside can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
And I gave enough steps outside my comfort zone to know that, yeah, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They had not been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was an energy there, an optimism and a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
They went to a small group of people for whom the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was making a giant pot pot that all <unk>
They will get it up at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some bright ones, and we opened up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later there were <unk> and <unk> adventure.
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time where <unk> was social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
On the 17 became <unk> from a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without a support of his husband, he caused an <unk> to <unk> and take the cause to her own, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can't have proven to be wrong.
I was in the shower at the fourth of a hotel in <unk> when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories and we made sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you've taken your hand from <unk> he said.
"You haven't been <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Given who we were and how life our life grew up with us now we can see that the men who had come to our lives would have come to us.
<unk> would have easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might want that to do that?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy, the right.
I can give you a <unk> in their lives, you can get courageous in each wave, the constant rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could take them and see it, you would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is here today, in the fourth or the <unk> row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing changed from the age of ancient <unk> <unk>
In those days when Indians we wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with an airplane now.
In that time when we <unk> the great prince warrior -- I was <unk> he was running a bow and with a <unk> to the ground, I found water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was a lot of that.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would get rid of this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get to my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to enable the magic to do that, they didn't know.
As a child, my grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this piece of technological technology was for my most magic.
It became a golden door to a world filled with pictures of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phone and the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it from <unk>
We <unk> our inspiration.
And so I came out, I came up with this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
It was books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a storytelling device that will connect to the readers of the whole world.
Can you know how to take the book.
Where we are.
They collect the text with the image, it animation and it and touch.
The narrative is getting more and more <unk>
But what do we do for that?
I'm about to launch a interactive app for iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I come back a character from the book.
In several times, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live in the GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl gets excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but that magic of childhood, to those ideas that are used by children.
For some reason, fireflies in a flask always turned out to me.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And actually, they light up your way in the backyard of the book.
Another idea that fascinated me about a little girl was that a whole galaxy on a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magic device within the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every book of fantasy there have always been maps but static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another hugely important aspect to me is to create Indian content and a contemporary of life.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of the fairies and the <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts -- the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in sleep cameras for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a children's children's story?
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that kids have been <unk> attached to their <unk> have not come out to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images from different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> of <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason the children don't do it.
So in order to regain this childhood ritual we have to go out and look at a chapter -- a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex, and then <unk>
So this is a digital collection of photos that you can then put on the Web.
A boy from London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A boy of India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Inside the variants of connection between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book, we have an interaction where you get out with the iPad and the video on and through augmented reality, you see an augmented <unk> group that appear on the inner plants inside the house.
At a moment the screen is filled with leaves with leaves with it.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to go into a world where the forces of nature will be reunited with technology and magic and technology goes to each other.
It turns out the energy of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic magic, and love love that we felt with a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why a lot of <unk> projects.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a director of the listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little coffee coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What would you do?"
How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems of what all of all, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's very simple.
It has a doorknob from on and on the ground.
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge of getting to 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> it sends up my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same moment in which it needs to be <unk> or some urgency of that style, but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> I think you need a <unk>
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure pressure to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for the patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week we will be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people are going to take them out from their homes, take their blood pressure, they send it to their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where the patients assume a position, come back to <unk> control and to be captains of its own <unk> but also it can help care of health because of the challenges that we face, like the firing costs of attention, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
We have techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did wanted to share it with you with a video.
We all have navigation controls in <unk>
Maybe we even have them on our cell phones.
We know perfectly where the ATM machines are in <unk>
Where are you all <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the closer to help this patient?
We asked but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please make it <unk> where, when is it open, because when it's open, because sometimes they open up in <unk> and other people are closed.
And more than 10,000 <unk> were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> can use their iPhone, and the next few weeks will use their cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I would like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also like <unk>
And we want to do it globally.
We are asking all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find and work and act like a center for the <unk> of the <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
And also, I'd like to invite companies all over the world that could help us verify these <unk>
You might be text messaging or <unk> people, for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in its place.
Please focus on this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed up with my previous passion but it was a little bit different because by using the camera that was in the planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera and the process ends up when you push the <unk>
For me, photography had more to be in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to push the press <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has a turn.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful ones, but with the common target to keep the level of <unk>
And when I say that, I mean <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can <unk> but I always want you to look like it seems to be captured in some way like photography.
You have to think that you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them look real?
They're the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
What do you create <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end of the end of the way we interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's really not about whether it's realistic but what we think is a realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> things that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way can create something that still seems like <unk> as if it came there.
But, at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's look at the brain, because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's actually going to combine different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like realistic -- I think these are those ones that don't even look at the things around our daily lives.
But by combining photographs, it's very important, because otherwise something looks bad.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that are going to continue to make realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the photos are <unk> they must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of different images with a perfect child.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think that this is a picture of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is completely comprised of photographs of different places.
And I think it's easier to create a place that will find it just because you don't need to put the ideas on the head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew that I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a pit of rock.
And yes, I even did red the house of the top of the island to look more <unk>
So in order to get a realistic result I think it takes planning.
It always starts with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here each piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful, and at a very <unk> time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody who took a portfolio of mine.
I'm not very interested to show you the details but the general side.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> <unk> it's a new thing.
Here's something weird happens.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please, light up the lights.
It makes more intensity, because writing about paper.
Why would we build technology <unk> at <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal line in which, say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to put on the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you say, for example, another technology, like transport, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation <unk> as fast as we could take a taxi in the past tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of technological development of a <unk> growth that every few years orders of magnitude.
The question I want to ask is -- looking at these curves.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
And let's get one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical curve. I know this until you appear something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what the world used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and I'm asking myself, is, what is that new way that <unk> the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing, if we're engaged in it.
I remember that the child is happening in the year 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because you feel that something is going on.
And we can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot to think about 30 or 50 years because it all will be so different to extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at long-term things.
The time scale that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So you go back about 2.5 billion years when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with many chemicals that were <unk> around them.
If you look at the way those chemicals are organized by us we give us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, he had floating some oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes on its inside.
Some of those drops of oil drops had a particular combination of chemicals that made them put in the outside of the outside of the outside and so the drops grew up there.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most mature cell forms -- these oil <unk>
But those drops were not alive, in the current sense, because each of them had a random recipe for chemicals.
And every time you were <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that we get.
So every single <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops of a way to be <unk> being better at the time to incorporate chemical <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more chemicals and <unk>
Mostly, they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, life chemistry, but things are interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
Somehow, we don't understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, it would be involved in this evolution without sense, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were in order to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved 2.5 million years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, you have exactly the same code, that same system of writing.
In fact, every living living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things that I did just for you: Now can we write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I'm trying to hide on the airport.
But <unk> Tom <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data in this fragment of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card with a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If I was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have spread it through the hall.
What was the following <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy, another billion years.
But then something another big step happened in which things were very different and was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information into the form of cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
In that way, for example, we evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way of avoiding penicillin and <unk> to create their small DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
And this communication gave rise to the communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and a <unk>
From that <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals of that community would become more and <unk> by evolution.
And the turning point happened when these communities came up with so much that, in fact, they came together and they decided to write the whole recipe for the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next stage is interesting for life.
And in that stage we have communities <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together like a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the brain cell or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than the cell phone, something that we call a organism.
The next level that happened within these communities.
They started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make information in community.
It's the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being responsible structures to understand and understanding information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage to them.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat any fruits because I knew wrong and got sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that before they had built these data processing structures that could have learned over hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built those structures of information accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution might now happen to an individual.
It could happen in the time for learning to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the communication trick.
So for instance, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of an idea of <unk>
I'm here sitting emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in his heads that holds some analogy to mine.
But we take something very complicated we turn it into sound, in sound sequences, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now lets us begin to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to perform <unk>
We now go through similar periods of periods of organisms that are <unk> our recovery methods and data processing and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
<unk> the computer <unk> the video tape -- the <unk> and so on.
And that brings us together to something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we do before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program before our eyes.
And now we've accelerated time scales.
The first stages of the story that I told you was taken a billion years out of the history of the story.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
<unk> and so on, they took less than a million years.
And crows like electronics, it seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that is <unk> its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that are working for <unk> would not be possible without the recent computer advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to teach myself <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a machine level, we put it on the machine and the machine with that does something that you didn't know, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes I use methods that we don't even understand good at all.
A particularly interesting method I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates at the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please run a hundred million <unk> <unk>
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, to run all those programs, and take those programs, and take those more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
So let's say I want to look at numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are going to come close to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, they are <unk> numbers, so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did <unk>
They put those and <unk> them to the rest of it.
And now we need the best ones to take the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
So let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and the kids would build the properties.
So we got a new generation of programs that have programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
<unk> again.
They were looking at some mutations here.
It's trying to try and get it back and get it to another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in a few hours, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that were saying absolutely perfect numbers.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to test them to see how they work.
They're dark programs.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know that, I have the safety that they achieve because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they did it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
One time I was going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and you get a card, you say, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to provide a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when they're getting complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than that produce normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the options.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so you can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, <unk>
The thing is getting faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog moment of <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what's going to come.
But now comes the lunch and I think I'll stop here before I get out here before I get away.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to let me give up part of my fake <unk> on that.
Before I deal with my talk, talk a little baseball.
Why not?
We are close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
He's going to go out of <unk> <unk> talks about statistics and use them to make a big baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope most of you know.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about 300, about 300, about 300 <unk>
That means that <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of game without being <unk> and anyone who is trying to <unk> the first base, it doesn't get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three tries of 10.
You know what they call a <unk> <unk>
Well, really, well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know what they call a baseball <unk> <unk>
By the way, that's somebody from 10 strokes, it gives you four.
<unk> like the legendary legendary Williams, the last player at the League of the League of <unk> in running more <unk> in a regular season.
Now I put this up to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and you can go to a surgeon who has a <unk> record.
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a remote place, and a dear self has two arteries that are <unk> <unk> and their family doctor comes up to a cardiologist whose record is <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting a lot of getting a lot better.
And its pass have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask you.
What do you think should be the average of a heart surgeon, or the <unk> of a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in the whole medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, though, is send them to the world, and I stuck with the mandate to be perfect.
You never, ever make a mistake and trying to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student, <unk>
Once a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman Sachs was studied until a blood exam.
Just like that.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the nurses Hospital in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my class of anatomy, we will be able to take the origin and the <unk> <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the frequent <unk> and not usual.
And I even knew the <unk> of how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And more and more knowledge.
And I was going very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from medical school with the impression that if you were <unk> then it would know everything, or as possible as you can, close to everything, because so I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady into the emergency room where I were working.
At that moment I was assigned to the <unk>
And when the emergency room requested to a cardiologist I was going to go to that patient.
And they inform the head of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I heard it, I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which was a heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops going to work and, instead of pump the blood forward, your blood goes to the lungs, they fill with blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I read about.
He gave <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in your heart.
He gave <unk> water <unk> so that I could get liquid it.
And within an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt great.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
I sent it to her home without talking to the head of residents.
I didn't get up the phone and I didn't do what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen it, I would have been able to bring information <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that will be done.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When they send her home, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inside of my inner who would say, <unk> is not a good idea.
In fact, I was so insecure that until I asked the nurse she was going to go to the <unk> <unk> "Do you think it's okay if you go to her <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said <unk> "Yes, I think I'm fine."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So it was that he signed up and the ambulance together with the <unk> they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I kept on my job.
At the end of the day, I would argue, to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was going to go home, at the time, I did something I don't do normally, either.
I went through the emergency room on the road service.
And there is a <unk> not that I was born from the old lady before, but another one -- he told me three words, those three words that most of the emergency doctors are <unk>
Other specialists who fear them too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and is that we see patients <unk>
The three words are: he remembers you?
He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with the total <unk>
And they said, "He <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the verge of death.
In an hour of having come to her home, after I was to give him high school, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk> blood pressure, which means a shock severe.
I barely breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff <unk> all their resources.
They gave medication to raise your blood pressure.
They put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
It had a mixture of feelings because after <unk> it was in intensive therapy and waiting for all the hope that they were <unk>
And in the age of two or three days, it was obvious that you never will.
It had a <unk> brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And at the ninth day, they left her to go. He was <unk> wife, and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of the people who die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks later, I was excited about it and experienced for the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture and sat alone, isolated <unk> because you can't touch your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that lets a teaching.
Shame is <unk> that I talk about is what makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that made it feel.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I was going to look at things and made sure that I didn't care about it.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send her home home?
And in my worst <unk> Why did I made a mistake so <unk>
Why do I choose to <unk>
Gradually, that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And on one day, you opened the sky and finally went out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if I had the efforts to be perfect to be perfect for no more mistakes, would do those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was teaching in the emergency department in a community hospital in the north hospital in upstate Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he started here.
I looked at her throat, I was a little bit.
It was sent to her home.
But as he ran to the door was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to making my guard, my chief asked me to talk to me in his office.
And he gave the three words: he remembers you?
Remember the patient who saw for a pain in the <unk>
So he went back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
It had a potentially fatal condition.
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but it can be the top, and it can cause the close of those tracks.
He didn't die.
You were <unk> antibiotics by <unk> and recovered within the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I got married, and I went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were going to be used to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought it had a <unk> calculation of it.
I took an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out, a colleague who was checking into the patient -- a certain sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, and I called the surgeon to be asked.
The other patient was very much diarrhea.
And I read liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague who did it.
I looked at it, and when I noticed some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, I called the surgeon to called the surgeon to call it.
Both of them were operated on and they recovered as well.
But every case I was <unk> I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most meaningful people have been over the last five years.
I'm embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get myself and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they didn't make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard of whether you heard about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear talking about the mistakes of other doctors, but you will not hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues, I would also have a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg, believe that I would have difficulty looking at your eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and whatever they do not sleep, and the ones that I know -- those who have <unk> outcomes and the ones who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction that you start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you take care of medicine to people who make mistakes, we'll get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of <unk> and a medical journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical research and mistakes in order to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote for the first article that I wrote for the Star Wars <unk> Black <unk> <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes happens every day, where one in 10 drugs are going on in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right, in a system where <unk> infections are more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, 24,000 <unk> they die by medical <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute set up 100,000.
In both cases, it comes to <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is spread every two or three years -- and we didn't care about it.
sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with pain on the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain -- comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and all of a sudden, my story is <unk> from contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't get their symptoms always in the same way.
For all of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we were <unk> and we eliminate all the professional professionals -- well, there will be no one.
And with respect to people who don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> white, white art, it's already a habit to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the <unk> to the head of <unk> surgery -- this is my worst <unk> blah blah blah. "What are your <unk> <unk>
And their students were <unk> <unk> down the head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> could say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where you can do it.
They need a medical <unk>
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The medical doctor is human, it's human, they accept it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
It takes their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
Let's get the mistakes of other people not with intention of <unk> but in a loving way and support that they all <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings are running the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I am human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel a lot, but I feel a lot of effort that I can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we took a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
Recently, I made a survey of more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to choose a half a half a day.
Not a lot, in a week was followed by a week to a group of companies.
The researchers recorded all the different <unk> tasks for these executives and time that we were trying to make decisions about those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every job involved a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only about 12 percent required an hour or more of its time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many people belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do you organize the way that those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems in the <unk> choose to be able to get it back to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know how many answers.
When I ask a question, as I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive -- please give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> at the University of Stanford, <unk> at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
There were about 250 different mustard classes and collected more than 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 water <unk> and this was when you were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that grocery store, but at one occasion, I asked myself, why do I never buy nothing?
This is the shelf of the <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in <unk> box that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him, "You know, this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out to me the buses full of tourists that came up with every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
<unk>
They had different classes.
He took a place for <unk> right to the shop.
We put out there six <unk> or 24 flavors -- and we looked at two things: First of all, what case people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when I had caught up 60 percent, when it was only six, about 40.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a coffee <unk>
So here we found the opposite effect.
Of the ones that stopped when I had <unk> only three percent of them got to buy <unk>
From those who stood when it was six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six, that if they found 24.
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> we would probably get <unk> less is good enough to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the <unk> problem of choices will affect us in real decisions.
We decided to not decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the issue of the day, financial savings
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see decisions about savings for retirement for about a million Americans, in between 650 plans from this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of <unk> available in savings plans in savings plans for retirement, <unk> program <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that there was true <unk>
We had <unk> plans from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the greater the number of funding funds were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two funding, the rate of participation was 70 percent or more, not as high as they wanted.
And in the plans that offer about 60 funding, the rate of participating in the <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there is a negative consequences.
So for the people who decided to participate, the bigger the number of choices, more people will be engaged by preventing actions or investment funds.
In the time there was more choice, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts.
But no one of these extreme decisions are the ones that we have to focus on to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences to deliver more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is to make the decision, that <unk> even when this is going on against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They're more likely to pick things less likely to be <unk> even though objectively they get better.
The main reason is that we will be able to look at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we're not able to do the calculations to compare and contrast and choose from that remarkable <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have in one way or another, in different research, so that they can try in their business.
The first is: <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, than less than today, than less is more.
People are always upset, when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But actually, what we're seeing is more and more is that if you choose to cut, get rid of strange <unk> choices there will be an increase in sales, <unk> the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> and <unk> 15 different <unk> increase in sales.
When the Golden corporation -- <unk> eliminated the products of cats that are less <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> greater sales and lower costs.
You know that supermarkets, in average, offer 45,000 products.
In a Wal-Mart store there are about 100,000 products.
But the ninth shop in today's world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce, in tin.
In the world of financial savings I think that one of the best examples that have come out of how to manage the best choices is that David <unk> the Harvard <unk> program.
All of the employees at Harvard are automatically <unk> to a safe background of life.
You who really want to choose, they give them 20 funding, not 300 or more.
You know that people often say, "I don't know how <unk>
These are all <unk> options.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they can't do it with their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people to people in this audience with a lot of vacation with the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read.
I'm going to leave you a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to take an applause if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> OK. Anybody who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I actually got to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first turn, that in the second, but I can tell you that the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the <unk> <unk> which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choice, they have to understand the consequences of every choice, and that the consequences must feel very specific in a very specific way.
Why is people spending 15 percent more on average, when they use debit cards or credit than when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't look real.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more positive than that.
We did a studio with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> a <unk> plan.
And that meeting is exactly how we did <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we had to add was that we would ask the staff to think about the positive things that we would be interested in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts for <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For instance, this is a study we did in a corridor of magazines.
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> across the <unk> <unk> show can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the classification tells me how to <unk>
These are two images of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know what?
This is completely useless.
<unk> have to indicate something to <unk> not the ones that <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge funds.
I'm supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think about, if just a little bit of a little bit.
We have to increase complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision to buy it in a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that allows you <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to put the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that give each one.
<unk> color outside the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk>
What I'm going to do is change the order where the decisions.
So half of the clients will go from a lot of choices, 56 colors, just about four times four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> in 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to do?
What are you all about.
If you <unk> the <unk> button in every decision, this tells you you're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that those who are going to have a lot of choices to few options -- we would have the default button over and over again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they continue there.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order of the order of the information.
If we started with the easy, you learn to <unk>
But if you choose the box of change doesn't say anything about <unk> <unk> of all of us all in ways to choose to choose.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alternate alternatives -- we can make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've presented to you were designed to help manage <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who work.
It's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is being careful to <unk>
And the more careful we will be in our best choices we can practice <unk> art.
Thank you very much.
In the years, in the East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter that would write to the government.
You had to log a sheet of text that has written with the machine.
And this for the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found an article with the wrong message they could track the footprint until the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that somebody could do this, so much that this is a lot of freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color of any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having a little yellow dots on each page that make them a pattern that makes them just and on your printer.
That is happening today.
And no one seems <unk> a lot of this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what's happening in the online world, we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
It's very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the worries to earn a lot of money, huge amounts of money.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
This is Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal media by stealing money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy on a <unk> computer.
The secret U.S. service, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen ice.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be more likely than any of us is the victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most online crimes online.
The second group of bombers that we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that the moves, they motivate them to motivate them the protests, they motivate their opinions, they motivate them.
Groups like Anonymous has been <unk> in the last 12 months, occupying a role in online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who are doing to protest and the last group are the United States <unk> the government that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of <unk> of the Netherlands or actually it was.
<unk> break the last fall because of a <unk>
Let's take the safety of the site and give it a <unk>
I asked her last week, in a meeting with representatives of the Dutch government who asked one of the leaders if we were <unk> <unk> people from people to cause the attack to <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die because of a attack of these?
<unk> is an authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why does the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services -- <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we would take a foreign mosquito authority.
And they were building <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring, and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, in Egypt, the <unk> <unk> based on April of 2011 and during the building of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder, there were notes of a company in Germany that had been sold in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government for <unk> the communication of the citizens of the country.
And they had sold this tool, for 3,000 euros to government <unk>
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments, provide the tools for governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments, also do this themselves.
For instance, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the German government to investigate their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes beyond today.
It <unk> the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all communication, and listen to the online discussions online, to get our data.
When we think hard about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that we will be born today, will be forever.
We were blindly blindly in any future government, in a management we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions you have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Central Park.
These are the cows of my dad, in the background, and behind the cows, the National Park.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences in the highest part of the south, which means that wild animals like them, they migrate freely out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that they killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and we found it dead in the morning and we found it very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value it so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
The people are warriors who protect our community and cattle, and they're also angry with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park.
A boy in my community -- at age nine at nine at nine at nine at nine years old, and this was the same thing that I was going to happen to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were afraid of fear.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because I even helped lions to see the pen away.
I don't think <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick lions so they believed it was about the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day, and they saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So they jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come.
I found that lions have fear of light moving around.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch with the one to turn out the lights.
And this is a small lamp of a <unk>
It takes everything.
As you can see, the solar cell picks up the battery and battery <unk> electricity to the little box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the box <unk> makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And that's how they see it lions when they come from night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them on my house two years ago, and since then, we never had any problems with lions.
And the homes in the neighborhood they heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals, and she asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see it, you can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've set them up in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now for a lot of Kenya, to scare other predators, such as <unk> and it's also being used to scare elephants over the farms.
Thank you to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funding and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community and install lights in the houses that don't have them, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a kid in meadows of the savanna, the cows of my father, and I used to see flying airplanes, and I was saying that someday would be within one.
And here I am.
I got the chance to come to TED.
My big dream is to get to a aviation engineer, and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other people's invention.
What's the next in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make a fence close with it.
<unk> I know you already invented electric fences -- but I want to make mine.
CA: You know, I would take it back once, right, right? I have tried before, but I had a couple of because I got a <unk>  CA: On the canyon. Richard <unk> are something big.
We're going to take it in every single step that I was going to have a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a small, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would get all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except America, South Korea, are the enemies.
Although I was sometimes wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until it all changed a sudden everything changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never starving.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister's colleague of my sister.
That said, "When you <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we're ready to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A living woman was dead in the street, holding a kid in her arms by looking at her face of her mother without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about themselves and their families.
A huge famine goes out to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only a few they survive eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also made more and more prevalent the hands of energy, all around me was completely dark at night except for the sea Sea in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the countries.
This is the river River, which is <unk> which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in some points, allowing North Koreans, to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river, sometimes.
I can't reveal the details of how I get out of North Korea, but I can only say that for the years of famine I was sent to China to live with <unk> parents.
But I just thought I would be separate from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years back to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life as refugee refugee was.
But I suddenly learned that it's not just extremely hard, but also too dangerous, because the refugee refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be attached to a horrible fate back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare became actually when I was arrested by the Chinese police and stuck on the police station.
Someone had accused me for being <unk> then I took my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it doesn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end up.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer told each other, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum in <unk>
But many can be arrested by Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although the <unk> had eventually released after a lasts international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other Koreans -- haven't had so much lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work, everybody can be <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years to hide my identity, I decided to put on the South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
It was a much greater challenge of what I was hoping for.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
It even went through a identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call with my pride of mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I did a plan. I started to study for the entrance entrance to college.
Just when I was starting to send it into my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had a little bit of money sent to my family, and as blame my family was going to be displaced to force to a location in the <unk>
They had to run immediately immediately.
So I started planning on how to help it escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the road to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China and walked to the border of North Korea.
Because my family could not speak Chinese, I had to <unk> it in a sense, for more than 3,000 miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
On <unk> I took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Again, our bus was arrested and <unk> by a police officer.
He asked them to go all and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and I said that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but luckily I believed me.
We did all the way down to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated by crossing the border.
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was liberated in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at the short distance from the South Korea.
I was going to come up and forth between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man says, "What's the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would care to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without <unk> the man was to the ATM and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans, and to get them out of prison.
I read it with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
<unk> <unk> a new hope for me and for the village <unk> when I was <unk>
And it showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the people <unk> needs.
Over time, after the long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieve their freedom is only half the struggle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families, and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice practice of the English and practical language, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with family still inside, and we send information and money and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans, an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans -- all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South.
This is <unk> <unk> stores fast food, <unk>
So the city planners came together, and they thought, we're going to change the name of the South Center so that it represents something else, so they changed Los Angeles to South Los Angeles -- like this is actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Los Angeles --  <unk> <unk> fast food, <unk>
And just like <unk> millions of other American Americans live in a food desert. The Los Angeles Center home for the food places to bring and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that food places to bring kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of infectious diseases in Los Angeles <unk>
For instance, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I would try to see this happen.
And I wonder, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go from home, you see the <unk> effects, that the current food system has in its <unk>
I see <unk> wheelchair and sold as a self-driving cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
I also got tired of managing 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was to plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it going.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to run it off.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> us together and we started to plant our forest of food, <unk> trees, you know, the nine full vegetables there.
What we do, we are kind of a group of paid for gardeners of all the <unk> of all the city and completely voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then somebody gets <unk>
The city is focused on me, and at <unk> they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> made an order.
And I said, "Come on, right?
A judicial order for plant food on a piece of land that no one was <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, let's <unk>
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. had the written story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a request in <unk> with 900 feet, we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, come on, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more arable land.
It's got 68 miles of <unk>
That equals 20 Central <unk>
So that's enough space to plant <unk> million <unk>
Why does the hell not look like this?
<unk> a plant will give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars to the result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, you cultivate your own food.
Your own food is like to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for <unk>
I grew up there, I grew up with my kids there.
I was thrilled to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow my art.
Like an artist from <unk> that <unk> walls, I <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> from that canvas.
You can see what the Earth can do, if you let it be a canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing that is a <unk> and how people affect people.
What happened?
I'm witnessing how my garden became an education tool, of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
They were <unk> to see how they affect the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> and provocative act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, that came up with a mother and her daughter, were like <unk> at night and they were in my garden, salt and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I was so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, "Do not temes people go to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh my God, I'm not afraid you're going to go to <unk>
That's the road.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter to put it in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they shared his stories about how this had affected them, and how they used to plant with her mom and grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed, so it was just for a second.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had, like about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all in a volunteer plan.
If kids grow <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If you raise tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if nothing of this is being told if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and your body, eat blind to you in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing when I are stuck with. I see <unk> kids who are on this road designed for them, that it doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take container and turn them into <unk>
I don't get <unk>
I'm not talking about free things, because the free isn't sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is putting people out of the street, getting the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and pride and the honor of growing their own food, by opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want you all to become a <unk> <unk>
We have to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That <unk> take their <unk>
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit on comfortable chairs and having meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, you come into the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> --  -- you can probably all agree with me that this is a very narrow road on it.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that <unk>
And especially if you go on the <unk> and these cars go out of it, that's not very nice.
Moreover, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, there are very close to the cities, we want a quiet road on the world.
The solution to that is <unk> roads.
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can pass through it, so all the water rainwater flow sideways and you're going to have a road for which it's easy to drive, and they don't waste water again.
The noise also disappear.
Because it's very <unk> all the noise you disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that on this road the stones on the surface of the surface goes away.
First of a stone, then several more and more and more and so on, and so on, and <unk> -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more harm.
Sometimes you can create bumps with that.
<unk> is ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see the damage in this material.
This is a asphalt <unk> like I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to light -- to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if you were <unk> they will get <unk> and <unk>
So if you drive down the road, you will take the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is we can use <unk> <unk> of that to clean <unk> and we can cut off the <unk> steel in very small chunks, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of <unk> from steel on it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, you use a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is do what you have to do is we heat steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and rocks <unk> back to the surface.
I used a <unk> oven, because I can't bring the great machine <unk> here to the stage.
<unk> is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, you actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we gave us a little bit of road, 400 feet from the <unk> highway, where we had to make a test lane to test this stuff.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road is going to last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and we test them in the lab.
We made the samples, we put a lot of charges on them, we put a lot of burden on them, the church then went into our <unk> machine, and the math and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using steel fibers to incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, even you can double the surface of the surface.
And now, of course, they have a sense of whether this worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before you can show them how the repairability is.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to BBC <unk> on his little gray radio.
I had a great smile on his face that was unusual at the time, because the news generally does it.
The Taliban was <unk> she screamed my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister's sister who could no longer be able to be able to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be able to <unk>
Every day, we would take a different route so that no one might suspect where to go to it.
We had to hide the books in the stock market so that we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us in a small room.
It was nice in the winter but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every once in a while, school was suddenly close to a week, because the Taliban were <unk>
We always wondered what they did.
They were <unk>
Did you know where they were <unk>
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province in Afghanistan. It was where her daughter, my mother, out to school, and so his father would <unk>
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It took two years ago, just to turn our home home for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father -- this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to get education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to train.
Over the years of the <unk> I remember there were times when I was very frustrated for our life and she was always scared and didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter of me, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can try to leave your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your own <unk> we will do it.
So, you still want not to <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that's been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the age and if my family hadn't been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate school in <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from his courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He will not just get away from my university degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I'm the first woman who's driving it down the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream -- but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I am the global ambassador, <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
This is why we <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
What's exciting is I see the students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see your parents and their families who, as my friends, would go through them, despite them and still in front of an opposition in <unk>
As <unk> it's not the real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter were going on the way from <unk> to her village, and they were literally disconnected from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When I get to her home, they are the phone, a voice picked up that if I kept sending her daughter to school, they would just <unk>
<unk> already, if you <unk> he said, "but not to harm the future of my daughter for your old daughter, and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers haven't been key in our success.
In fact, they are often the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who were in school, remember, it was illegal.
But over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that the Americans see the fragility of changes.
They assumed that these changes wouldn't last a lot after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and her parents who were <unk> for them, that the <unk> see a <unk> future, and a durable change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of the <unk> would get it wrong.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
never, ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never get a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution broke out by the surge of mass <unk> and massive <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens.
And it was a big revolution.
Women and young men <unk> were on the edge of the table -- the fall of the regime, are carrying freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a courage <unk> the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and some losses from about 50,000 people were able to release our country and <unk> the <unk>
However, <unk> I left a heavy load -- a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of <unk> society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've wanted, along with a lot of other women, rebuilding civil society, <unk> a global transition and just towards democracy and <unk>
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm -- I started organizing together workshops about developing skills and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women, we founded the Women's Health <unk> for the Peace -- a movement of women, the women's counseling leaders, very <unk> <unk> to advocate for the autonomy <unk> of the woman and for our right for the <unk> of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was getting more and more <unk> and <unk> policy policies and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won an <unk> of National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day in the world of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> of mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American Ambassador and the attack to the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the killing killing of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and the human rights violations.
Our society, made up by a revolutionary mindset, it will become more, and it's been away from the ideals and the beginning of freedom, dignity, social justice, which we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and vengeance became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all today to deal with our success story of <unk> <unk> and elections.
I am here today to confess that we, as a nation and we choose wrong, we made the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't brought peace and stability and Libya.
The <unk> list and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and <unk> with selfish policies of domination and <unk> as much for men as <unk>
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but women's values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs national dialogue and creating consensus with more than the election needed the election, that just <unk> the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the women's representation, of the female <unk> of female than it will need the representation of <unk> and so used to it.
We need to stop acting as agents of comfort agents and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female discourse that not only <unk> but also to put it in practice <unk> instead of <unk> in <unk> collaboration instead of competition, <unk> rather than <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, supported by war, needs desperately to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between the female perspectives and the <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to make that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions have the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> that it involves all the humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so, just like the uterus cover completely <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion -- <unk> all of it.
So you say, "My mercy is <unk>
This is how you tell us, "My mercy is about my <unk>
That all of us will be given the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a funny question, which has an equally biological answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is that they all make a good deal, why is she left?
Why was anyone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. At Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> green <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, I thought I believed my alma mater, me, <unk> my head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man who loved more than no one in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you about the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap.
It could even be their story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies from the list of <unk> <unk> between them -- Johnson and Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I have almost 20 years married with my second husband and have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message to you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all religions, every religion and every religion and education.
It's all over the place.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse only happens in <unk> <unk> and long duration or said in the families, the last place where we want or we would expect to find <unk> for which, domestic abuse is so puzzling.
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would sit with a man who touched it, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was about 22 years old, and in the United States, women in between 16 and 24 years has three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women who are killed by the age by partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I was also a typical victim, because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold, November night.
I was sitting on my side in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had had a <unk> university university -- and I was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what was most struck me at that first encounter was ready and fun, and it seemed like a <unk>
I had a big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things he made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He made it all over the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and loved all of me -- that I was ready to go to Harvard, who would be passionate about to help teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done before.
And it was why I translate it in that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much important for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went out of New York and to leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to make some sacrifices for your mate, so I would say, I left my work and <unk> and I went back in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling on a <unk> <unk> who was walking into a physical trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And here's where those <unk> are going to come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where I was supposed to be so safe to buy three <unk>
One had the <unk> of the car.
Another put it underneath the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns that are because of the trauma that they lived on a kid.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never lifted up my hand, my life was already on <unk> every minute of every day.
The first physical <unk> attack happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my neck out of my mother and married him.
Despite what happened, I was sure that we were living happy forever, because I loved it, and he would also want me so much.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was just a very scary sense, by the wedding and the fact that they form a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I would never get any harm.
I spent twice as much more in our moon.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so hard in the head that <unk> various times against the car <unk>
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey -- went down by traffic and threw up a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> he kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is the victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in their life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had a really good company.
Going back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to tackle their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't they just get <unk>
Why wouldn't I get <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we all know the victims, we know something that you normally <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the violence in domestic violence is happening after the victim has been late to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include the permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to marriage, <unk> of financial resources, and energy handling system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who are usually forced by the judges to spend time without the man who supports their mother.
And we still keep asking why it doesn't just go away.
I was able to go, because of a final <unk> beat up my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, if she was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everyone over the world -- to police, my neighbors and family and family and whole.
We have the tendency to encourage victims to victims like headlines, <unk> women are going to provide <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
And for some people is a way to say "The fault is by <unk> as if the victims are going to be <unk> intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also learned that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them, and that they will promote their lives joyful lives and happy and mothers who are completely free of violence, such as mine.
Because it turns out that I am actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence.
I went back to <unk> with a kind of cute man and we have those three children.
I have this black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to have ever more, ever is a gun loaded with my head in the hands of somebody who says it wants me.
At this moment, you are thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you there are a few people who are listening to me right now, who are being <unk> or they were <unk> or they're <unk> themselves.
The abuse might be affecting his daughter, her sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end up with my crazy particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've been hearing here.
<unk> is only in silence.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence just shedding light on it.
We victims we need everybody.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They put the <unk> to light talking about it with their children, their coworkers and family and family.
It would take their view of survivors as fantastic and <unk> people who have a <unk> future.
<unk> the early signs of violence to join consciously, to be able to slow down their climb and show the victims of a safe switch.
Together, we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the <unk> and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call my Cameron Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years now.
And I feel like at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because it shouldn't have been dressed in the room because I shouldn't have been dressed in the room because I shouldn't have dressed you <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing on a <unk> scenario, so you have a lot of luck -- I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to stand up now, but they find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These collaborators are very <unk> less <unk> I don't have to use them.
The worst part is going to go through this sweater, because it's when you're going to make fun of me, so you don't do anything while holding your head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but it's also <unk>
I have completely changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, never had a boyfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I took my back, and I took the hair of the kid.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan like the one that I did two days ago for the work, there are very little that we can do to transform our minds, which, while shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being courageous means to be honest.
I'm on this stage, because I'm a model, a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and my job sector -- that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made that model is because I won the genetics, and I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this inheritance.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined the beauty as and youth and symmetry, which we're biologically hardwired for <unk> we have also associated with a high and <unk> shape, and a white skin.
And that's my heritage heritage that I've known for making money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now shown <unk> and maybe there are some of them who are <unk> <unk> They are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, we <unk> them from knowing so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told each and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- that is less than four percent, were not white people.
The next question that people always make me is: Does it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't take care of that.
But then, what would you really tell each of these little girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> ninja and poet, which would be <unk> because you were the first.
If after this spectacular list, it's still <unk> No, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of <unk> magazine or the CEO of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you need to be a model is to say you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's surprising, and it's not a work you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike laparoscopic surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Sadly, once you have been the studies, and you have a curriculum and a few jobs on your back, no matter what you think about -- I mean, if you <unk> you want to be president of the United States, but you know, you want to be president of your underwear for 10 years, people would look at you weird.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yeah, pretty much all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that <unk> me and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal ground, but it was a child.
So I used it with my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came up with me.
Here I am on a <unk> party.
Here I am with my football team and <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are creations for a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always do is do things for free?
I have too many six inches before 20 inches and I never use, except the previous couple of it, but the privilege I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and forgot to take money, and they gave me the free dress of Cambridge,
When I was a teenager, I was going to travel with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> an angry agent to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges just like this, not what I am. And there are people who are paying for a price for how they are.
I live in New York City, and the last year of <unk> adolescents who are couple and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino kids in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It's how many times I was <unk> and <unk>
When I was researching this talk, I found that about 53 percent of the girls in 13 years in the United States they don't like their body, and that figure goes up to 78 percent in 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer you're expecting is: If you're a little bit thinner and you have the most brilliant hair and you have a very happy hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe this is going to be <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with clever creative people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I've never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my eyes every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with some more thin legs and the most brilliant hair and the most brilliant hair will be happier?
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most enjoyable legs that have the brighter hair and their clothes, but probably be the <unk> physically <unk>
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation for race and gender and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something to retain this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have from success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was enough enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 <unk> pictures -- and I didn't know the <unk>
There were no <unk> or <unk> no opportunity to replicate the pictures, not even a minimum of lighting on it.
In fact, most of them took them <unk>
My story begins in the city of New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and five percent.
He gave the chance that we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what it comes next.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why not take you to New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
This is when we start asking the tourists that they were going to take away the photo.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, no one has <unk> with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much life will change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than a moment of concrete or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time on a October week and to make us reflect on our age and our evolution over the years, and not just the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always get the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see life through their eyes and how you perceive and interact with it.
That particular time in concrete we spent together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, on one of the travels -- we were walking, when all of a sudden it was stopped and pointed out a red <unk> of the tape that was <unk> in <unk>
And it described to me what I felt about five years of foot in that place.
<unk> remembered their heart <unk> with the force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family photos.
I am always the one that takes a picture.
I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and I don't get to get close to somebody and ask him a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The <unk> are located in the most <unk> birds.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughs -- like Muslim <unk> characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that they associate with Parliament -- but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. Do you know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World that are mainly in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we have 16 species of extinction.
So why are they <unk> they're important, and first of all, they provide sustainable ecological services.
They're our <unk>
<unk> the cadavers up to the bone.
They help killing all the bacteria to absorb the anthrax that will not be because of them would spread and caused huge losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where you don't have <unk> people take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge substantial importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture.
<unk> was the symbol of lip and maternity shoes, and along with the <unk> and the unit between the <unk> and lower Egypt.
In the mythology <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are doing a lot of important <unk> in the open sky in places like Tibet -- there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are in the extreme <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason you're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, all four species of <unk> are in the critical list of endangered danger -- which means that in less than 10 or 15 years <unk> and the reason is because they fall under the consumer consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug.
This drug has been banned for veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Because there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge amount of time to <unk> the number of moments of rage has grown enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up to the top of the <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds -- they cut them in half.
These are birds.
In West Africa, there is a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds.
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they're going.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so we can focus on a housing problem is not going to be <unk>
We have to work with government at <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We are talking to them about appreciating the <unk> on the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we get.
How can they help? It can become active making noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you get out of this room, you report on the <unk> but talk to your families, with their children, with your neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw it flying <unk> without energy expenditure in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every single thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> I was young, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> Ivory Coast and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
We went to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing good work in Africa.
Instead of that, everything you would have <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people to grow food.
So, we came with <unk> <unk> to the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that drops into the river <unk> and teach the local and grow Italians and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, and so they were excited to come to work, and sometimes they didn't <unk>  We were amazed that the local, in so fertile valley, they didn't have agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't make anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here."  <unk> for time to save the people in Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa grew <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato sauce, and in Zambia, to this size.
And we can't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> look at the <unk> look at the <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate it.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you know it, you're never going to <unk>
I thought we only did the Italians we were doing mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what Americans were doing, what the English did, what the English did, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> look at the <unk>   <unk> seeing the waste that would give us to the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, you read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western Europe, we've given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage that we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries <unk> and we treat people just from two things: or the <unk> or are <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> which means <unk>
Yet they mean two different things.
<unk> I try to make any of a different culture as if it was my kids, "I want to get a lot."
<unk> I try to deal with all of a different culture as if it was my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The small thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the guy who opened this conference, put a pole on the ground, and he said, we can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to be 27 years just answering the people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start there, you will never get anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion -- the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
It would never come to a community with an idea, and sits with the people in the <unk>
We didn't work from offices.
We assembled us in a cafe. We assembled in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for their own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we helped them find the knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years back, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not for once, for once, but not in meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never had, and they will never tell you in a public meeting -- what they want to do with their own money, what a chance has a chance to have a chance.
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't even know it, because they don't touch their public meetings.
What do we do? We do we work with you, and we work face to face, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor physician from the company, the family doctor and the family doctor in the business of the business of business, in the table of your kitchen -- and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a form of living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city in Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to get away from this condescending junk that we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to me to see a question: "How can you do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
I was <unk> and ...  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of <unk>
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history passed away from '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor in philosophy before I was involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says -- <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
planning is the kiss of death in the corporate spirit.
So now we <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what people most <unk> in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come up with you.
You have to offer privacy, privacy, it has to be lovely to <unk> and then they will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What would you talk about this tomorrow?
Local people. That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- <unk> fossil revolution -- <unk> <unk> and a moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how do we <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
government? <unk>
They will be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a beautiful story that in a <unk> magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> came up with this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in a hundred years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wasn't within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve, and they <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses and the manure produced by six million horses that would be impossible to address.
They were <unk> they were <unk>  so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the New York City.
So what does it happen? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States came up with <unk> manufacturers -- <unk> <unk>
So the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories -- we were able to put factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to give them <unk>
Otherwise, they're not going to come in with you.
Then you have to give them an absolute dedicated service, <unk>
And then you will have to tell you the truth with respect to <unk>
The smaller company, the bigger company has to be able to make three things <unk> the product you want to sell is to be fantastic, you have to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic <unk> and you have to have a great financial administration.
Do you know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that I can do, to sell and search for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked and observed and looked at the 100 mining companies in the world -- <unk> <unk> Ford, all new companies Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common -- only one, no one was started by one person.
I had no word like that, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody begins a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> in bars alongside their dedicated comrades who will do for you, what someone did for you, what somebody did for this gentleman who is talking about this <unk> somebody who's going to ask you, what would you get?
What can you? Can you do that?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." Look at <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't switch a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects come from questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we be able to borrow more things without calling the door to a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings, and understanding our <unk>
How do you share more our hopes to empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York City, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> who give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It was always going to accommodate the music.  There's a show in New <unk>   The city has one of the most beautiful architecture of the world, but also one with the greatest number of abandoned properties.
I live close to this house, and I thought I could turn it into a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and she was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and death and I thought about it.
And this led to me a profound gratitude for time and lived in time.
It gave it clarity to the significant things about my current life.
But let me get this look in my daily life.
I think it's easy to be catching up day to day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends turned the wall of this left house on a giant board and painted on it and painted on it and he painted on her <unk> <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspiration in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment but the next day the wall was filled with and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I died, I want to be filmed by <unk>   "Before I died I want to sit on the <unk> line of <unk>
Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died, I want to live outside the <unk>
I want to die for you once more."
Before I died, I want to go to the bailout of <unk>
Before I died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope for people to make me laugh at me, and they gave me comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It is about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it is about giving the thought and <unk> and to remember what is most important to us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the center of civic center we made a kit and now have been <unk> in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things that we have is time and our relations with other people.
In our age of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, to find ways to keep the perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that will become more power.
If you think about death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, people around us cannot help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> is 22 years old and very <unk>
No speech, but transmits joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
You share it -- <unk> happens what will happen.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't matter religious differences, and look at this: it's never been <unk>
When singing from our childhood, trying to <unk> the words that I could not even see me, it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but remember the year that she came out with each one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we had when I was four years old, you pee in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady <unk>
It doesn't look <unk>
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit fit into the concept of <unk> of society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though they didn't consider them within it, that could only mean one thing: which was <unk> autistic people and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain complex affecting social communication, to learning and sometimes to physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in each individual differently, which is where it's so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, will be diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development of the development that goes faster in the world, there is no cause or <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new person in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
It takes a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in her own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in row around the room, looking at the machine and eat whatever it would have the <unk>
As I was growing up, they got more different, and the differences were getting more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature of a child that would see the world without any of the human who had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family when I wish they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have been taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that would not want to change for normal.
<unk> happens by high beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean you're wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could <unk> one single thing to <unk> and Sam and you would not have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences you <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift on their inside and honestly, the pursuit of normal is the latest sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change is dying at the moment where we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what it must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a teacher of communications, which would give a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  It was really afraid.
But when those conversations, I felt that I felt that it would have felt that when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt like I had these conversations with the students, I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a big communication.
We desperately need a huge communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to medium and health care and health care -- between others, and if we don't know what we don't know about this, work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and that its engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
And so why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us that you just study the <unk> but study the <unk> that are the sound structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing your science, carefully with <unk>
The slang is an obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, they can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> affordable is not the same thing that makes them <unk>
On the contrary, as Einstein, did it all be as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories, stories and analogies. They're ways to come up and adapt to their content.
And by presenting their work, forget the signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they're called <unk>  What do you do the <unk> <unk> kill, and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it goes too much in the language of the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that actually inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a very simple phrase <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then providing graphs that will adapt to our other senses, and create a deeper sense of understanding what they get.
I think these are just some key to help the other open the door and see the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when they have fixed this equation, for all means, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words of the entire Oxford English Oxford <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds great.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor at the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is the one who is looking for a public charge no matter or the platform or start, and when he wins, he gets the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
One thing to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament, allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were told in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was thanks to the courage of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted with <unk>
They put in the Tower of London and he <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such a popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> as well as <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's because of an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America right after independence.
So, they had to address George Washington, its leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They had all kinds of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, <unk> <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the United States <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about tested quality.
And not even with it was <unk> they had the idea that you could be picked King for a given term.
And I could have <unk>
Everybody got tired of the world to get tired of it, because this debate is <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper from a poor <unk> and you always have this <unk>
What caused the failure and <unk> was that the House of <unk> was against <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want to be able to be able to be <unk>
They didn't want to call it the King for if he did to him or her left ideas.
So they wanted to give you the most precious and more unfortunate title that they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, but we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign up and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take a serious title with such a ridiculous title, and <unk> as President of <unk>
And then finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite, until I had been able to figure out the Senate has never been <unk>
President Barack Obama is kind of going to keep up there, waiting for the Senate between in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>   <unk> possible that we keep waiting for <unk>
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is what I want to tell you about is that the title of President of the United States doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads in the world, the largest economy and a fleet of flying and a fleet of the <unk> and so on.
The reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear <unk> etc.
So, at the end of the Senate the Senate and the House of <unk> <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that you're the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
Politicians try to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but really, really change a lot more the words than what they might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to feet on Earth in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the darkness, but I can't see a lot more.
I hear voices that talk about but, above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and rocks <unk> with primitive tools.
Like others, I have a cheap firefly <unk> light onto her head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that <unk> hole that drops out of feet on the ground.
I <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days earlier, that he lost control and dropped countless feet on that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are at the depths of that hole in the risk of their lives without paying any reward and, often, dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they may never will.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in over 70 countries in six continents, and, in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> at the Summit <unk>
Among all the amazing people that I met there was a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO which is engaged to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not to such grade.
When we ended up talking about it, I felt very sad, I was very excited to ignore this <unk> of our days and thought, if I don't know, how many people don't do it.
He made me get rid of my stomach and weeks later, I flew L.A. to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
I even considered them my second home.
But this time, we have the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much as the number of displaced Africans all about slave slave for it.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of a <unk> of <unk>
However, today you can enslave entire families by generations per generations of 18.
Now, amazingly, slavery generates revenue for over 13 million dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false and good education promises and better work to find that they're forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and can't escape.
Now, slavery today is operating in <unk> the welfare industry have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost everybody else, and yet it's illegal throughout the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature at 54 degrees men, men, women, kids, in fact, entire families -- entire families -- <unk> in a heavy <unk> stack together mechanically mechanically <unk> in their heads, up to 18 at the same time, and they take them out of the <unk> <unk> that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 hours a day.
There was no food <unk> not to drink, and the severe <unk> made it to even pee out of a lot of <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too warm to touch and it stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run into the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I thought my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> who was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me so clearly that I would demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't give you any direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, anything.
I wasn't a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they were already.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for its release and he complained that I would be able to get it.
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found children carrying rocks by carrying rocks for miles through <unk> terrain until trucks waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children who charge them and the kids would take them back to their heads with <unk> <unk> made of clubs, ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
Do you have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk>
When you hear the word slavery often we think about sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness, they warned me that it would be hard to work in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
They took me for a little bit <unk> that gave this dirty <unk> basement, <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as it is known to be local for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms, they have lots of private rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of that only seven years -- are forced to entertain customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Every place is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their clients.
On the <unk> I remember there will be a fear of <unk> <unk> and, in that minute, I could barely imagine what should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where you <unk>
There was no doors.
There were no big enough enough for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, since touch a very difficult issue, it is important to point out that slavery even sexual traffic -- that happens around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex slave people.
It is everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles is another activity that often relate to <unk> labor.
I went to Indian villages where there were whole families going to come up with the silk <unk>
This is a family portrait of family.
<unk> hands of black is the father, the blue <unk> and the red <unk> of his children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me their stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still expect yet, we can get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay for us.
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When I got there, I was going to look fast.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen family in a boat, two older brothers -- some younger kids -- some more young kids, makes sense right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
The children are separated from their families <unk> <unk> and forced to work extensive on these boats on the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up there, I was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The <unk> branches of the trees plunged into Lake <unk> often trap networks and <unk> and fear, they are thrown into the water to unleash the branches.
Lots of <unk>
Ever since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love, it's not going to flee and, like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> it is to the younger slaves under their charge.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the one one to a single one of a day.
On the winter night and <unk>
And it would point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will be because somebody else decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> on a road in Ghana with partners of <unk> a fellow <unk> with their <unk> suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and touched the window.
They asked us to take it through a path of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we got to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out quickly.
And then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started to go down, we took the <unk> that we would put on the road, and after walking close to an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as I put in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had in front of a mass of holes that could fit in a football, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
Many women had children strapped to their backs, and as they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These mining are <unk> in a well in a little part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The pits are up to 90 feet and these people have got carrying heavy bags of stone and then will be transported into another area where they put out the stone to be able to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if you look closer, on the side, we see to work on other less fortunate, and also to boys.
They're all victims of injury and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> is going to end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> by <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When her father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
When he died his uncle, <unk> I selected the debt of the uncle to be a slave in mines.
When I met him, I had worked in the 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so severe doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet it's forced to work on night and day on that mine.
Even so, he dream of being liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in face to a remote possibility of respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to get witness to them and make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really think that if we can see each other as human beings, then it makes it very hard to be <unk> like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They're from people, real, real people, like me, who deserve the selves and dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that happens that I don't think about these many beautiful, <unk> people, I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images wake up a force where you see, in people like you, and I hope that that force will turn on a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make applied mathematical math and there's a peculiar problem for whom the <unk> are like the management sector.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  that we will see later.
But the ballet demand one degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity and probably some <unk> <unk> that can be a genetic component.
Sadly, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary skill as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> which, at the time was a virtuous ballet <unk>
Over the last few years has been making a lot in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with an weakness <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately, the only way we know if there is actually a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's a frustrating thing that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological <unk> so they don't serve the blood analysis and the best thing we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside clinical trials, you never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic and what if patients could do the exam they could do with them.
They wouldn't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do, as a really conventional way for a try, you can see, in a certain sense at least -- we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of vibration from string <unk>
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds, we can imagine as a dance of a vocal ballet ballet because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs to produce sounds, and we all have the genes needed -- for example.
And as they did it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about the time it takes a child to learn to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of the vocal cords as we <unk> and as well as Parkinson's affects <unk> also affects the <unk> organs.
On the plots of below, you can see an example of <unk> <unk> of string <unk>
We see the same <unk>
And a vocal, <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech gets more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurologic test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
They're both accurate. Well, but the test scores are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They are very low cost, and we all know what happens to happen.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it appears to scale.
These are some targets that are incredible ready to address.
We can reduce our patients.
You wouldn't have to go to the clinic for <unk> routine.
<unk> <unk> we could get objective data.
We could do a massive <unk> weapons for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at the general scale.
We have the chance to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So when I will give you the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's Women's Initiative.
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and begin to address these goals.
We have domestic lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, you can call under a price and leave recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all of these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What will you get from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease, TR: TR:
You can see, some people may not be <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking at <unk> the factors of confusion searching for the actual markers of the disease.
TR: They have a <unk> accuracy right now.
<unk> much more than that.
In fact, my graduate student, I have to have a fantastic job and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network too, what the project is, we now have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I did <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We were <unk> in the dark, in <unk> rooms and usually we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin still more perfect -- we make the impossible possible and we were <unk> in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists, with a lot of years of experience and a real taste of images and photography.
On March 11, of 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were going on in Japan.
Shortly as long after, an organization where it was <unk> where it was <unk> where <unk> was in the place as part of the feedback team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers knew that we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I went to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village, in <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The water level of water recorded over 24 feet and over three miles away inside.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took off the mud and we left the fast houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish, <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> pictures and cameras and <unk>
They all did the same thing.
And we can bring them to different places in the villages of all around them for <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented an enormous part of the personal losses that that people had <unk>
While they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the village.
It helped clean up, the enormous, giant <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor that I had the honor of that day in me to clean the photos.
And this was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I was going to get away from myself my horizons that something happened.
When I looked at the pictures, I found some who had more than a hundred years old, some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't help to think like <unk> how to fix that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was as <unk> and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had caught up the face of the girl I had to have a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the appearance of her own, and that would be so tragic as I had the photo <unk>
In the time of time, they came up by lucky ones, and they got more <unk> so he went back to Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
In the end of two weeks, I had 150 people in <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got to <unk> a town in northern <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the libraries of temporal libraries that were <unk> where people would claim their photos.
And the time you put in <unk> is a different story depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could be an hour. It could take a couple of weeks.
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw almost by hand using as a guide areas that color and detail water had no destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all these photos <unk> in seawater, covered with bacteria, with algae, and even with oil -- all of it along with the time I continue to <unk> by that was an important part of the project.
We couldn't take the picture unless it was clean clean and dry and been <unk> by his <unk>
We had lucky <unk>
We have a <unk> of a <unk>
It's very easy to harm the pictures already <unk>
As a time once said -- the leader of my group is how to make a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these photographs were kind of a relationship to the photos.
I had started to <unk> her itself, but he stopped realizing that <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have been made, we were able to put it into a single picture and <unk> the whole picture.
When I collected their pictures shared something about his story with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the pictures at a fire station between the rubble of the rubble of the rubble to be his house, but his colleagues would <unk>
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the sponsor of closing the barriers to the wave.
It had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Your small children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
It took a week to find his whole family and know that they were all surviving.
The day he gave her photographs his son was 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, these pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could come back to look, something that I could remember from the past that had never been tagged by that day on March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there with hundreds of them -- hundreds of them were helped to clean up with more <unk> photographs -- the great majority -- the great majority of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped to bring back to 90 families and hundreds of <unk> and <unk>
Over this time, we don't actually spend more than a thousand in teams and material and materials, most ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, one place, a dear one.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing that we would take to us, but the first thing that we would want to look for.
What the project was about to restore small pieces of humanity, to give someone your connection to the past.
When a photo comes back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that you're given.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected it with something bigger -- to bring something, using its talent for something that is not electronic models of perfect skin.
In order to finish this email. I sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I failed, I could not avoid thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
In particular, a picture with women in different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, I was <unk> because a very similar picture of my grandmother, my mother, my mother, me and my daughter just <unk> hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few of our basic needs are the same. Right?
Thank you. 
<unk> <unk> were inspired by awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition of just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of technique <unk> a new technique that can create video in slow motion of light into motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can be able to see behind the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without the <unk> and the <unk> challenge really the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I'm going to turn on and <unk> in a <unk> of the second or a second, in many <unk> to create a pack of photons of just a millimeter range.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a <unk>
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how they spread out of these photons into this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --   -- remember all this is happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  <unk> many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> enters the bottle with a pack of photons and it starts to <unk> and inside, you start to <unk>
Some of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble that bounces out inside.
In that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the reflections of the upper part of the bottle, it looks at the bottom of the bottle, after a number of boxes, that the insights were <unk>
Now, if we take a <unk> and <unk> and we make it go down the same distance and we see it in slow down to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to sit to see that film?
One week -- a week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film --  on the movement.
And what about how to test with nature <unk>
You can see the waves of the waves from the table and the tomato <unk>
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, and I thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition here.
But if you look at once more of this <unk> you'll realize that, as the light <unk> <unk> doesn't <unk>
Why? Because the tomato tomato is <unk> and the light bounces out inside the inside and it goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phones, they will be able to go to the supermarket and check whether the fruit is <unk> without having to <unk>
Why do we create this camera at MIT?
As photographers, you know, if you take a picture of a <unk> it comes into a very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the <unk> <unk> so you can just get some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw and <unk> in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow you to see after <unk>
The idea is that we could throw something out of light on the door. You will get into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
We could extract those multiple light bulbs.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, there is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons go back to the camera, but interestingly, in a slightly different time.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique capacities.
It has very good temporary resolution, and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects but we don't know what point it corresponds to a distance.
By projecting a laser, you can record a picture in common. You see on the screen it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, we <unk> and we'll try and analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
We can see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> <unk> with what's around the curve, <unk>
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light light by the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But, of course, because of the tissue and the blood -- this is pretty hard, so this is actually a request to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new building of a <unk> to solve the problems of today's health issues in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, he turned science in art, an art of <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data we collected every time are not just for scientific <unk> but we can be able to can be able to figure out that we can be able to have scientific <unk>
We create a new form of computer photography with slow and color code.
And let's look at those waves Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But this is also a funny thing going on.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> they get away from us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out that, as we are recording almost the speed of light, we have strange strange effects.
The order in which the events are happening in the world sometimes appears to be invested in the camera.
We have a corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's already time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A smartphone can be <unk> and it gives you individual freedom.
With a cell phone can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a smartphone you can tweet a message and initiate a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone you can record a song, and you can make it famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that time, to this town.
So here you can see hundreds of thousands of thousands of people who are looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people gathered in searching for a change, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who are you going to have a smartphone here?
<unk>
Hands up your cell <unk>
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot of a lot of people today have a cell phone.
But I'm going to talk about me today about my mobile, and how life changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> information lines.
<unk> raw data.
Why is that data there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Peace Commission filed a <unk>
<unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European <unk> every single city provider in Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to who.
Who sent a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company, or their Internet <unk>
And in all of Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet providers, all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, all say, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin -- and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk>
The <unk> was the secret police in East Africa.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time you use the <unk>
So I asked my phone phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, who please get to me, all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to heaven, and I didn't get a concrete response, it was all blah.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a lawsuit I decided to take a lawsuit because I wanted this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, "We're not going to give you this information.
At the end of the <unk> a deal.
They took the demand and they send me the information that I would get.
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court would <unk> <unk> for the German law of the E.U. law.
So I got this ugly about brown on a <unk> inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty hundred and 5,000 pounds of information.
I watched you and I said, well, it's a huge archive.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what is <unk>
So along with <unk> <unk> and Open <unk> we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can come up and go out, go back and forward.
You can see every step I give up.
And you can see how I'm going from <unk> on train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
All of this is possible with this information.
That gives a bit of fear.
But it's not just me.
It's about all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talked a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call them between them.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we ended up with this big network of communication.
You can see how their people communicate with each other to what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see this all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what's doing the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks with whom, who gives you an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at first, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in my pocket.
And the <unk> I had known who I participated in this protest, and if the <unk> would have known who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, not every single <unk> <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and companies want to store as much information about us as possible within and outside of the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives, and they want to be <unk> forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you get home to your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not <unk>
When you go home, you send it to your representative that just because business and government agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your cell phones that will give you to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello, TEDWomen, what's going on?
It's not enough.
Hello, TEDWomen, what's going on?
My name is <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me into the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why it takes all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
and Muhammad <unk>
<unk> C is not genetics.
It's not <unk> no <unk>
Nobody <unk> the <unk> of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, although they are.
Just by accidents, like the one that happened to me at birth.
Now, I'm not a inspirational source -- and I don't want any of you in the present one.
It sits wrong for me, because at some point in life, you want to be disabled.
Let's go for a walk.
<unk> from Christmas, are in the shopping center, drive into <unk> and what you see?
16 empty places.
And they think, "My God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and that P. C is just one of them.
There will be a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, disabled and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm in Park in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood, and my disease had the same <unk>
I also love that if I want to walk from my house to New York, I can.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe when you don't believe it.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters older sisters were <unk>
If my three sisters older were going to the public school, my parents would go to the school system and <unk> that I was also outside, and if we didn't take all of the note -- all of the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk the five years putting up my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another approach that was used was to hang a dollar in front of me for the <unk>
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong.
Yeah. The first day in the children's kindergarten was walking around as a <unk> woman who has received a lot of taps.
By growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arab and they're still all of the family.  I think no one realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as a slogan of campaign.
The people that I grew up with had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be <unk> a lot of hunger for the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating, so <unk> from dawn at <unk> is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, <unk> That's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so I was sent to dance school to dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whether I can walk with <unk>
I am from New Jersey and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I would too.
And when my friends were going to pass the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going to go.
I was spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we won't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were <unk>
On the summer camp, I often was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk <unk> I would put little cups on the back, put me down on the back, and I remember that the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring but before I do yoga I was a comedian of <unk> that I couldn't wear <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on my head.
My parents came up with this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital Hospital.
I went to college with positive discrimination and I got a fellowship for the University of Arizona, which was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> <unk> of the theater.
I was all <unk>
I did all the least smart tasks, took the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I made a scene from the glass zoo of <unk> my professors <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> <unk> <unk>
I have paralysis <unk>
At the end of the end of the end of it.
Thank you to God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running at the head of the theater, crying in historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, to ask her why and she told me because they thought I couldn't do the stunt scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunts at risk, you can't do the <unk>
It was a role for the one that had literally been born and they gave it to an actor.
college was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors with no disabled papers.
When I graduated home, I went home, and my first tour <unk> was as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> <unk> friend in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there like a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the <unk> <unk> were not white, and not white, <unk>
You just give it to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I did <unk>
On my first tour, I took a famous book <unk> in New Jersey to New Jersey and never forget the face of the first comedian that took when he fell at the <unk> that I was at high speed on the New Jersey road with a driver who had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to claim the first place, but I know you never heard that little nasty man who says that women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival of New York, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in media media and at the time reminding the <unk> <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> to the Arab was much easier to fight against the challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I went to me as invited to the news program by a cable <unk> with Keith <unk>
I walked up as if I went to a graduate dance, I would join a studio and sat me on a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, "You can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and he said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I hold on the bank desk to not get out of the screen on the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
Finally I had my chance and the <unk> I knew they would not come back to me.
But not just Mr. <unk> come back to <unk> but he was just the <unk> <unk> and hit my chair.
Something like I learned with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that kids are <unk> but they never get away from me or no older than a little girl.
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
He played online clips to comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite favorite <unk>
What is it?
We really should pray for her."
A reviewer suggested even my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as the race.
If somebody in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then you can't make somebody else in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the greatest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said they didn't work, but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media media, I don't think <unk>
I hope you can create more positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more <unk> <unk> that would be less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need to use all the society to teach well as well as our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I arrived at <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my assistant, incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the New Jersey state in the <unk> of 2008.
And I started "The <unk> <unk> a charity to give young Palestinians a tiny bit of what my parents would get to me.
It was the only time my father saw me living live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk>
My name is <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small people.
I don't know their name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small town in the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
<unk> propels the small people to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities -- there's no job, no perspectives of future.
He just was living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day you get a guy who offered him to <unk> after dinner at <unk>
He knows a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to her family.
They present to a young man.
Finally the house.
It starts a new life.
It has an objective of life.
A beautiful day at <unk> under a blue sky bursts a car bomb.
That child of that little village with the dreams of the great city was the terrorist terrorist and that dynamic group of people were <unk> an terrorist organization connected to al Qaeda.
So how a story of a little town of a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end up with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to start their future, waiting for a future, and this was the first thing that came on.
This was the first thing that he put it out of what we call the <unk> period.
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young people who were <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking at something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of a opportunity, of employment, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffer from the highest rates of <unk>
By 2030, three of every five people who live in cities are under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunities -- the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence -- to be the story of cultural cities.
And in my hometown of birth, 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work at school.
They do virtually nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital <unk> where I was born.
I remember being in front of that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I never gone?
And if I had been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support a few young leaders at a business degree.
<unk> about 90 leaders juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had a rainwater on solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, that because I was a college student, <unk> frustrated, was the perfect white thing for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point A to B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way of <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started pumping motorbikes to local residents who they typically couldn't afford it.
And I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some point in time to go to hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do differently?
I think its ability to identify and harness a new opportunity.
It's the spirit <unk> and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking so hard.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who was attending to one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of corporate initiative, and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from abroad.
If you ask somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a <unk> and design company.
He created a farm outside of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> that he said, could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it started the flowers of flowers for weddings and creating gardens in houses, and the city companies and now is working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the families, the young, they can go together, and, as he says, smell pink rose <unk>
By the way, he's not growing pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the Mohamed presence had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO working for government, but their history, it really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
We encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
We had business solutions for local problems.
So to inspire young people and create a <unk> culture culture is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and orientation for <unk> in development and set out of their business.
<unk> to the young people who need to do -- <unk> the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, <unk> spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Peace Park, this is how it called, when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the <unk> for him.
It gave them the chance to escape the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, to turn the young people out of entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their innovation and to have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my father in the <unk> <unk> area in the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest.
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be the way that we were going to be able to pretend that we were the first human beings at step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful lake lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square feet with the heart of apple <unk> expensive balls balls and <unk>
And I was <unk> he was incredibly angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy like to pull out what they thought was going to be able to clean up their <unk>
That question went on with me, and it was <unk>
Who clean our <unk>
No matter like <unk> or where you want to take it, who clean our trash into <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean up our trash, of <unk> tons of waste and two billion tons of <unk> every day.
I wanted to meet you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who makes that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and she walked on their routes and I interviewed people in office and facilities around the city, and I learned a lot of a lot, but it was still a <unk>
He needed more <unk>
So I started working as <unk> of trash.
Now I didn't just travel in our trucks.
And operated the mechanical and the mechanical bar and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong to be rapidly <unk>
It costs a lot of <unk>
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies were still <unk> the weight of taking on their body of trash every single week.
It's also danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> loss <unk> is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and coming into traffic all day and <unk> around you.
They just want to <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the <unk>
And also the crap itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless <unk>
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
He never stopped coming.
It's also like a breathing way or circulation.
It always must be movement.
And it's also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> <unk> are the most important hand in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first taste of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of the waste and effective and effective in a day, this starts to take it out of its container and its dangers in real ways.
If we had controlled for decades, and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old <unk> we don't have space for what the engines of the economy begin to fail when it's endangered as well.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I'll just point their relationship.
And then there's what I call our average average speed necessary.
With that, I mean just the speed of the time that they used to move into the <unk>
We usually don't get rid of it, we can't get cleaned or we carry on us with us our coffee shop, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forgot about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side to take it out of it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about weight collection that maybe you can help reduce stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They are on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when <unk>
And their work allows us to do us.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us safe from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow should always stay in shape or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste truck truck on the street, I took my son, and I went down the stairs running on and there was a man doing his tour of paper <unk> like I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you to do his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and looked at me, and he said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be OK."
Shortly after that, I started looking at weight collection and I went back to this man.
It's called <unk> we worked together a lot of times and we did good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species that we have to include and have to figure out all the costs, even the real human cost of labor.
<unk> waste is what we think about when we talk about junk three percent of the waste waste in the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one that you see somebody whose job is to clean up the garbage garbage -- you will take a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you much.
My work focuses on the connection to think about our community life, forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally <unk> of conditions and local traditions.
I brought you two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a <unk> center of several stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa,
This is the kind of building that showed us like my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought I thought was, "I want to go <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many of these buildings there are many of these buildings there are a lot of important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people cannot afford to buy things.
Second, you need to take a lot of energy because of the <unk> <unk> it generates heat inside, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it comes to a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees above the year.
And thirdly, its look has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a worth being so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted with the ancient marketplace that is this structure in the open air where thousands of people are going and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the site, which is located in an area of much growth of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, putting all the inputs on the building.
And it extends out with a <unk> atrium, that creates a space in the open air in the building that is <unk> by its own shape, and the rain.
And around this space we have applied to the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on each floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we would bring to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the air, and also of light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the <unk> of the <unk>
Do you have some properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We are building that with these little <unk> parts, which are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little <unk> crystals that use the light of the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- it was not what they were doing.
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the commercial center -- because in order to end up there were more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was a lot more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we get a great advantage by putting in the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas and bars that would create this oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof that collect water from the inside.
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a big project, the bigger that I have designed, I needed not just understanding the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, and the tradition and culture.
In that analysis, I made a special focus on <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen Internet doors with almost straight lines.
When I went to place, the first design operation we did was expand into existing streets, creating 12 early blocks that are similar to the size of the <unk> and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select a few points in relation to the idea of the <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell on the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a heat difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So you make a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then on the low plant we have all the connections to <unk>
And it also responds to local norms that make a greater density at the upper levels and a lower density in the floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving up to the community the space is occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can climb and <unk> and make activities, such as a <unk> race in the morning, or to jump from a building to the other.
These two examples, have a common focus on the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities growing up.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's life is changing communities and local economies at the same rate growing up buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture by looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and that they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new child entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had huge amounts of hair very bright and a little bit of nice <unk> <unk> it was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I <unk> my sinister plan.
I was a day after the <unk> out of school, I was a little evening, and I hid in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took from my teacher to my teacher City book.
And then I did.
I took the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just a few facts.
All the Like --  And I set up to bring the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other teammates had very good grades as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> notes around the world, no imagination.
I put them all rows of <unk> and myself a row of a row -- just to be there, because it was <unk>
I'm still amazed what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I would never get <unk>
It was all <unk>
I would never get <unk>
But most of all, I was passionate about the reason why I was bothered by that this little girl was so small, it was so good for <unk>
I got rid of jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
You can also make it lumpy birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of children in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> loneliness, or the long duration or the <unk>
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the laboratory in which we study <unk> in all of its possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's a exaggeration to say that if there were no former <unk> there would be no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> <unk> no <unk>
There would be no King <unk> or <unk> and <unk>
No Shakespeare.
I put up the school lists for high school, because we would have lost "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
There is no longer <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the jealousy, almost that you have all of them.
This year they take this year about 100 years of his <unk> <unk> for the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also of the ordinary <unk> my God, all we could have.
We think about a child trying to leave the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forget about how relentless it is.
I mean, it's books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know how the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they're going so well together, the novel and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious as the jealousy that is reduced to the person, to their wish, to their <unk> are a good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel similar, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel awful because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
By being <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details are going to be like, <unk> the knife, right?
The <unk> make all of novelists <unk> and that's something I was trying to understand.
All that she does for pleasure could give birth to the other, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool charm that <unk> detects in his lover, you add it to his collection of <unk> instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an <unk> emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> from information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the great amounts of brilliant hair and cute little hair <unk>
The <unk> are <unk> from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> which is so successful -- <unk> language is so successful with jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony of soon listening to the door and <unk> the <unk> of your lover -- then it defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text.
He says, "These are a scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us feel <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for knowledge, search of truth -- really painful truth -- in fact, what to <unk> <unk> the more agonizing the best.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need, that makes us suffer, that makes us experience it causes a lot of profound and vital feelings than a wise man who can <unk> us.
It's telling us that we're going to go looking for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> are going to reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
Is there any other excitement of us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other excitement that teaches us to look at intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young young man who was being consumed with the idea that his woman would get it.
And Freud said that there was something strange in that man, who was not going to have a wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion with no cause.
But he was looking at things that she was doing his wife, and not realizing <unk>
<unk> <unk> or would just accidentally accidentally stand up with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
The novels are very good at this.
The novels describe very well how <unk> make us look at intensity, but without accurately.
In fact, the greater <unk> the more we are, the more we become the residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to doing violent acts or illegal acts.
The <unk> drives us to behave in completely <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me when I was eight years old, I <unk> it, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman from Michigan from 52 years of age was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from which would send himself awful messages by a year.
For a year.
She was trying to send her to the new girlfriend of his former former <unk> boyfriend. I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
What is a huge thing, even though it will be creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel of Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of the American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try how the jealousy, <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere in the realm of neurons, the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his more famous character.
Tom <unk> is going to be <unk> or want what you have to <unk> to be and <unk> from what you're ever <unk> and it's under the floor. <unk> your name, takes your <unk> cow bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the path of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all over the world, as much as I sometimes wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in time of envy.
We live in times.
I mean, we are good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
The novels show us <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not safe when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> Street <unk> and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> at Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of rat <unk> <unk> which needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius.
Oh, I think <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but we <unk> it and <unk> it with <unk> in each of the mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and eventually in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you put in <unk> <unk> to all with your solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And it tells you that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who don't want to leave your hand.
It's one of the very few times that we see <unk> moved in the story. It seems to me this very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
In the next minute, they're the same side.
Suddenly, you can admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we let us be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the greatness of the other.
We can adapt to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we expect that to happen, let's remember that we have fiction for <unk>
Only fictional fiction, jealousy.
<unk> used to kill them to the table.
And look at what <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk>
We are in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On the 21st of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped outside of the module of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea, <unk>
<unk> and Aldrin were alone, but their presence on the surface of the <unk> was the culmination of a collective process of <unk>
The Apollo program was the largest mobilization.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget today.
The Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked for 20,000 businesses, universities and universities and government agencies.
<unk> people died, including <unk>
But before the Apollo Apollo program went on to the moon.
He walked on top of his surface, of which it came up after death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They didn't make a lot of <unk> <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> the cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to show the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> some ask, why <unk>
Why do it make our goal?
And you can also ask, why can we climb the most <unk>
So 35 years ago, why will they fly over the <unk>
Why play Rice <unk>
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo wasn't just a victory of the West on the Cold War on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to precious precious powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technology's compassion.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> and all of the smallpox.
Technology seemed like to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with a candle -- but in 1969, the Apollo crew -- 10 miles an hour.
Since 1970, no human being has come back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the Apollo crew of Apollo 10, and the passionate joyful thing about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the problems that we imagine that technology would solve how to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, you seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that they didn't go to the <unk> tube tube -- the rocket <unk>
I knew that this would be the last mission to <unk> but I was completely sure that I would see the colonies on Mars.
So that happened, it occurred to our capacity to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have found us, and we had enriched it with trivial, <unk> things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing bad about most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation in Silicon Valley, in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies that are <unk> in the years that we <unk> Microsoft, and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, specifically -- the incentives that venture capitalists are offered to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the investment of risk caused us to <unk> creation of ideas <unk> by funding problems, or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in Mathare Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their greatest point without worrying about the risk, they preferred investments that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had a problem to invest in technologies like energy, that they need a huge capital and whose development is in the long term. We've never invested in developing technologies that are intended to solve big problems, because they don't have a commercially immediate value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But go to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular, and that's never going to happen.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global consumption of energy comes from renewable energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want the sources of alternative energy that can compete at price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are aware of what policies and international international <unk> development development <unk> a significant increase in research and development and energy development and some kind of value of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we will see a global energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, they're not to be.
We know for the time that famines are a result of failure on food <unk>
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are political crisis that affects the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like power or systems for storage and <unk> and food -- but there will be massive as bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Aboriginal President declared the war to cancer in 1971, but we soon found that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant to treatment, and only in the last 10 years they seem to have been found effective and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can have and must, but these four elements have to be <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to be able to solve the problem, and the institutions must support <unk> must be really about a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve big problems, it is true with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no competition <unk> like the Cold War, there is not a politician like John Kennedy and <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the moon it turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, it wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we're not missing the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> the ideas that have been about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a huge decline of trust, is a very widespread belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think the <unk> and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you about today is a different story about a <unk> an objective and a task, I think it gives a more clear idea about it.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about it on the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
And I think that it can be <unk> in some activities, or institutions and that could have increased in others.
I have no clear.
But I can turn to the opinion polls and the polls of opinion are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has <unk>
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> about 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, keep the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still pretty <unk> the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway away.
But that's enough?
What the opinion of opinion are recorded are, of course, opinions.
What else can you get?
What you look at is the attitudes attitudes that people make sense of people who are asking certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
It probably would be asking for asking, "To do what?"
And that would be a very sensible answer.
And you could say, when you answered your question, "Well, I trust you, but in other not."
So it's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a particular kind of official or a person or a person, is going to be uniform in all the cases.
I could, for example, I would say I trust you in a certain elementary school that I know to give the reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my most <unk> friend for a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we have got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why do we think all of that knowledge when we think about trust <unk>
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real confidence, because they try to challenge the good judgment of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what happens to the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not that objective that I was going to do.
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what it's <unk> to trust, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I am <unk> not to trust what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who had their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> which then disappeared with them, and I think, well, they were too much <unk>
Having more confidence is not an intelligent target in this life.
Give them deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say it, it says, yeah, OK, that's what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
So it's about doing a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that a person is <unk> in raw commodities and is responsible and honest, then we have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not accountable, we can't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to get a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that I see <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
And if it's like this, I haven't got any <unk>
But that's what we're going to do is we're going to have before trust.
Trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've tried to build accountability systems for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and so on, who would make us easier to judge their task to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see the problem is that it takes more time to make the wise performance that will be going to be <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we found that the accountability system that is meant to ensure <unk> and <unk> test is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they do <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard work, like <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> as we say.
Sure, you all know some similar examples.
We would get all of that, by the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if it would be worthy of being worthy of trust and <unk> to the people who are reliable and if you try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, but simple actions that don't do <unk>
Third, the task.
Let's take the task to rebuild the trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should be rebuilding the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct some trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the confidence in short, is shape, because they give us a little bit of other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You've got to give them the foundations enough to trust you.
You've got to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> by all people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to get <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is a daily day, everywhere, doing it ordinary people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
And the shop where I buy my socks says I can <unk> without giving you explanations here.
I take them back and get the money, or they turn it through the color of the color I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson on that.
If you get vulnerable to the other side, that's a very good test that you're worthy of trust and you have trust what you're saying.
So at the end, I think what we're pointing is not something that is really hard to get.
What people rely on is the relationships, and in that frame, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we have come <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen in which imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been getting increasingly more and more and more and closer to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a tactile screen and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
I first created this tool that goes into digital space so that when the strong <unk> on the screen transfers of its physical body to the pixel of the pixel
<unk> can take their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool, you break down.
But the two hands remain still outside the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of the hands?
In the National Science division of Microsoft, along with my mentor instrument, <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
We put a transparent shot with the cameras deep to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift your hands out of the 3-D space and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and files have a location in real space, it's as easy as a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and you can try to bring out lines or words with the virtual sensor that there's on the bottom of every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands.
In these examples, we have to focus on the digital world.
And if we reverse the papers and we make digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a <unk> device or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If you take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make it physical so that we can be physical and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the Media Lab at MIT with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we create this single physical pixel.
This magnet <unk> behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as the users can move the object anywhere within this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of quantum levitation and metal and <unk>
And by programming the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and will be able to reproduce and be able to reproduce and keep in the physical world.
They can teach physically and distance and distance and the famous shot by Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physical reality of the time we want.
The students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and, unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physics part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities.
As you see, digital information is not just going to show you something but to begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without us having to get rid of our world.
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you put that barrier, the only limit left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was thrilled to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to <unk> a school to athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother, he said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After they survive the Cultural Revolution, they believed firmly that there was just an immediate path to <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter whether I would work or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer singer as well.
This was me, on my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult would get the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends <unk> me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much higher to train.
My dream will never be <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life -- a second class happiness would be the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look for another <unk>
No one was like, <unk> Okay.
Let's go to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to America in 1995, and what the first books were here?
Those <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda a convenience.
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said to me, "It's so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> trap.
I find it with a new culture also led to my reading <unk>
It makes a lot of perspectives.
For instance, this map came up to me from place, because this is what the students in China learn.
I had never happened, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves people's perspective.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There's up to research fields like comparative comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the comparative reading worked for research, so why not do it in life <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
It can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and <unk>
For Buddha -- they're all <unk> lust, fear and duty <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path to <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> on the way Alan <unk> Instead of getting lost in translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For instance, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened me up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know you will not be feeling or <unk> ever.
Having a broken dream is really not compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, the dreams, of where the passion comes from.
Even a broken dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I am here today, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology, in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
And Alex came up to the first session using jeans and a <unk> came up on my office in my office and took off the shoes and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> like a first client.
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it became easy enough to move my head while I would choose the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> I said, Alex, and so I looked at it, she was right.
You start to work after, you home after, you have children later, to death later.
For <unk> as Alex and I had time to have it.
But shortly after, my <unk> would help me to push Alex to tell Alex to talk about his life.
I was <unk>
I said, "Yes, he's coming up with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not as if it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> said, "It's still not, but maybe you get back with the other.
Moreover, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel a head after what they were doing, but this didn't make the Alex <unk> were a pause in the development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment, and we were <unk>
And so I realized that this kind of astronomical civilization was a real problem and had real unintended consequences, not only to Alex and their loving life, but for careers, the families and the future of <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that nobody comes to adulthood.
Hands up if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove the dream of a <unk> I want to see. All right, <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. This is the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen at 35 years.
This means that eight in every 10 decisions and experiences and transcendent moments that shape their life will have happened for when you have 30 and <unk>
People from more than 40, not <unk>
This audience is going to be fine, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we get.
We know more than half of the Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future future 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something that wants to change themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality is changing more times during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that the female fertility comes to the top of the 28 and things become complicated to <unk>
The <unk> are the moment to bring them over their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are critical to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which its everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called an adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the people are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of time of <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> an extended <unk>
The journalists who are <unk> names <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> what's actually the decade that defines the <unk>
We were saying that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not right?
What do you think that happens when you call it a <unk> on your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole it to that person the sense of urgency and her ambition and this is absolutely nothing.
And then every single day -- intelligent, interesting as you or your kids and daughters get to my office and tell me something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not very much.
Or they say, "Everybody says that as I start a career before the 30, it's all right."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are because I still have nothing to show you.
I had a better sign on the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My dates during the <unk> were like the chairs.
They were all running, and they were <unk> but then at some point around the 30, it turned up the music and all of they started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who was standing, and so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when I had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little extreme, but you don't get <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge pressure at the age of 30 and so many of you will start a career, choose a city, and to have two or three children in a very short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that begin to show, which is a lot more difficult and stressful stressful things to do everything at <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red sporting cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
<unk> realize you can't have the son you want right now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I doing?
I want to change what the people are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having a identity.
He said I'd like to work in art or entertainment, but you still couldn't choose, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And even though I grew up with a very hard time, his previous life had been even more difficult.
They were often in our <unk> but then they woke up herself to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day he came his head on his legs and he cried for almost the entire hour.
I just had to buy a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning with his many <unk> but then I got watching the empty space that follows after the words <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was at the point of <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have an accident.
Who is going to take care of if I get <unk>
At that time, I was very hard to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What it was that Emma needed was not a <unk> that was actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew that this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex and I worked with Alex as I just worked on the previous decade of Emma passed away.
So for the next few weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that every single man or a woman, she deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who became aware of that identity crisis and <unk> identity.
For identity capital, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be later.
I didn't know the future of <unk> race and no one knows the future of work, but I do know this: I know this: identity capital generates identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> exploring <unk> I'm looking for exploration that shouldn't count, that by the way, it's not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who would explore jobs and make them tell.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you at the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds are limited to who you know, what you know about, how do you think about how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will come out almost always comes from outside of their closest circle.
The new things come from what they're called a weak ties.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have a job.
But the other half no, and the weak links are the way we can get to this group.
Half of the jobs created never <unk> then, know the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how the data is happening.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose to choose your family, but I know his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma will soon take her family into a partner when it has a partner and it does, their own family.
I told Emma who time to choose her family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit out that 20 or even the 25th or even the 25th and I agree with you.
But choose the person you live now, or you get married, now when everyone on Facebook are starting to walk to <unk> not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means to be so intentional in love as you're in the job.
<unk> your family must be aware of who and what they want instead to do instead of doing it is going to work or kill time with anyone who will get them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate of a cousin of a cousin who was working in a art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That money supply gave a reason to leave the boyfriend with the <unk>
Now, five years later, it's special <unk> in museums.
This guy with a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, I love her new family, and I send a letter that said, "Now the spaces of innovation in emergency room are not enough.
The story of Emma might sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
The <unk> are as a airplanes that come out from the Los Airport Airport coming somewhere in the West.
Right before the <unk> a light fits on its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or the 25 or the <unk> a good conversation, a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the years, or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea of spreading all the <unk> that we've heard of.
It's as simple as what I learned to tell <unk>
This is what I have the privilege of telling <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get an identity capital, using their parents, choose your family.
You don't want to define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're making their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very tough job in management consulting for a job that was even more <unk>
I was to teach you mathematics to graduate students, in the public schools in New York.
And like any teacher, I applied tests and tests.
I will give you tasks.
When the job came, <unk> grades.
What happened to me was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance had no scores of <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, they're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was so convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time for enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you succeed in school and in life depends on much more than the ability to learn from a quick and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become <unk>
I started to study kids and adults in all kinds of <unk> <unk> and in every study my question was, who has a success here and why?
My research team and I went to the Academy of <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what we were going to do, and we tried to predict the military and the military and who <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children would take away from the competition.
We studied professors who are working in our own hard <unk> what teachers will still be teaching for the end of the school and the <unk> who will be the most effective to improve the results of their <unk>
We teamed up with private enterprises, asking asking what these marketers are going to keep on <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all of those contexts, very different contexts emerged a feature of the success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't good enough, physical health, and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve very long term.
<unk> is having a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not only for the week, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying determination in the public schools.
I asked thousands of high school students to make my sense questionnaires and then waited for more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater likely to get away from <unk> even when the <unk> in every feature that I could measure, the things like the family income, the results of testing <unk> even the safety that they felt at children when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or in the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how little it knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we make determination in the <unk>
What do I have to do to teach kids a solid ethical <unk>
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The more honest answer is, I don't know.  What I do know is that talent doesn't give you <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination is commonly related, or it's even related to inversely than talented projects.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination of the kids is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and they learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to get <unk> when you <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mindset growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to do.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to do it.
We need to measure whether they've been successful, and we need to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start to start to start all again with the lessons.
In other words, we need to be certain about making our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memory, is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese character.
From that moment, I was passionate about this incredible language.
But for a abroad, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall Wall
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so anyone who is to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language.
I started thinking about how a new and quick method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Ever since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes in every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20 <unk> characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic <unk>
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read traffic signals, <unk> understanding the basic idea of the web pages or newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it might be possible until it's <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who is going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the shape of fire is a person with the arms on both sides, as if I were shouting <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> <unk> but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The <unk> symbol looks like a couple of doors in the old West.
I call this eight characters.
These are building blocks to create many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two is company, three are a company, three are crowd.
If a person stretches their arms, this person is saying, <unk> this big.
The person within the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a spike as <unk> within the whale.
A tree is a tree, two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put out a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of course, as a tree, is quite an idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two together, it gets very hot.
Three together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. I put a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> had somebody at home?
This person is coming out hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, be careful is <unk>
So we've already gone for almost 30 characters.
By using this approach, the first eight <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with each small effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters -- which is the same thing that you learn from a Chinese Chinese Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started making sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed in the beginning, because Japan is in China.
So a sun next to us, we create Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked up on the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, capitalism has become a date.
A mouth that tells you to come out is an exit.
This is a slide to remind you that I have to stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be <unk> are the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician magician together.
The film was held his imagination for months for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand
But when you see that film, so many times, you get to understand that it's a remarkable thing.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial complex of <unk>
However, the magician magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The tendency actually took rise to years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> <unk> <unk> a girl dressed in the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about? <unk> Yes.
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the magician magician was done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
It was magical shoes to defeat the armies made by the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing about the unique robot's of Oz is that the most wise characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did Star Wars <unk> my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I had a child.
It's only three years.
He wasn't invited because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of supervision had been <unk>  So, he slid in the room and was amazed as a mother -- leg with her <unk> behind, and I didn't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I should have the sense that Luke get an army for <unk>
<unk> this with the magician <unk>
How do I make Dorothy your movie?
We have a good deal with them with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world I want my kids to grow up to <unk> OK?
Why is there such a lot of toxic toxic force in movies for our children, and so little on <unk> <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this stimulus.
I know for experience that Princess <unk> doesn't give me the right framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first kiss. I really expected the car to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is done, I have a <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on <unk> and get your reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and defend the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, although those guys, they're not really their target audience.
They make a great work to teach girls how to defend themselves against <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, and both real, lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies about being war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all time continues to find rise in classic after classic every one of them on the adventures of a boy or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and the son, or two men who are raised a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, eventually came out of <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in shops.
Do you remember what the critical criticism said when it came out of <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost no one of these movies happens to <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not been burning and <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend about the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that should be <unk> In the film, there are more than a female character in the <unk>
So, you have to get <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more than the boy than you love --  All right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things in each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet I rarely see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality film, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- an idea of consensus on what is a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> is not the test of <unk>
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of film is happening in a embassy where men and women are hiding during the California crisis.
We have a lot of men that have deep conversations and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great moment for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to the bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So we would focus on the numbers.
In 2011, from the most of the most popular movies, how many of them do they think they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then is okay.
But there is a larger number than this is going to get to <unk> this room.
The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what it was like, <unk>
One in the United States, one in five women said that has been sexually assaulted ever in their life.
I don't think it's the guilt of the mass entertainment.
I don't think movies for kids to have something to do with that.
I also don't think that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics -- one of the things that I think is a huge amount of sex.
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do you don't get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to beat up with violence and then pick the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very startling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our willingness to keep <unk> and we expect that to be <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our kids to keep their power.
I mean, I think that the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly to the parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of man is radically changing.
You've got to read about how new economy is changing the role of the <unk> and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite character of Star Wars <unk> Do you know what you want.
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them to achieve their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want to give you less stories where I read to my <unk> <unk> and <unk> and most stories where he looked at work is joining a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people improve and become better people, like the magician magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine and one of the things that I loved was looking for the sea of the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see.
Yet with the time, I went to <unk>
I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love of love and archeology.
And eventually when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because suddenly in Egypt, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to a <unk> miles of length along with the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see by using the infrared
This is a place located in the eastern region of Egypt, called <unk>
And the place, in the eye, it seems to be brown. But when we use infrared and we process it using <unk> color, suddenly the place is seen as bright pink <unk>
What you're seeing are the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by the construction materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptians of the <unk>
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an old ancient city, called <unk> <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the old Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
It's really important in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East, there was this great renaissance of ancient art, and architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere within this enormous supermarket <unk>
This area is huge, it's about roughly <unk> by <unk> feet.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved into this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to get at random at random it would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes, and using baseball <unk>
So we use data NASA to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this kind of elevated area that you see inside the circle here, that we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptian scientists doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like you take it into ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five feet down below a white layer of mud, we found a dense layer of <unk>
This means that in this possible location location, five feet down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years that date back from the East World, exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also find <unk> <unk> work and <unk> which shows that there was a workshop shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Middle East, these are the rocks that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle East in this place.
We also have evidence of a jewelry jewelry shop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but it will go into the place in a future near <unk>
And most importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote by my favorite quote from the Middle East, it's probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago:
To share knowledge is the highest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that.
So apparently TED was not founded in 1984 <unk>
Do the ideas that were actually started in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk> house.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that's made.
Now we had a group of obese <unk> on cars.
They are racing on a racing race and they go in direction to their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide with the door of their house.
There are bike flying everywhere, wheels that go on to its side, the <unk> of the wheels that ends up in <unk> <unk> <unk> the threshold of the door.
In the lobby, or what's going to be on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light, the light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
On his chair, on a brown party.
It's a horse that is talking about.
You can feel your blue <unk> making your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you're going to be about to get into the mouth.
They went on a side and trained to their living room.
In the room, and making a peak of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing on the middle of the center of the center, singing <unk> One more <unk> One <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The soil has been coated with a yellow bricks and from the oven.
Okay. You open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest that takes each spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk>
And I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist <unk> waiting, I guess, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ladies and different habits of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers of numbers, look at them just once.
We had the names of dozens and tens of strangers.
They give entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who was able to memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I thought, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and he has one of the best <unk>
I said, <unk> when you realize you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I'm not a wise.
I actually have a average memory.
Everybody involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some old techniques that invented two and a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that they used <unk> to memorize their narratives and that <unk> academic used to memorize books <unk>
And my reaction was, "How did I have heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the room of the competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English, although a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you are an American journalist,
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order of a deck of <unk> cards live in national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me me.
I mean, you have to start out of something right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange trip to me.
And I ended up spending most of the year -- not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely with the worst memory in the world.
Their memory was so bad that I didn't even remember it had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed us to see how extent our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He's based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went through a evening together in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And when it comes back, it was a number of treaties on writing writing something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time where this idea of having <unk> and disciplined memory was not a thing as rare as it might be like today.
A long time, people invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but we've also changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would say that they have changed also cognitive either.
As we already have no need to recall, sometimes sometimes it seems to be forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you're still passionate passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there is <unk> like this around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College from London invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to be able to know that it has brains in some kind of structural or different structural or different <unk>
The answer was, no.
Are they just smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually no.
There was a really interesting difference between the brains of the memory of memory and the kinds of control issues with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI machine, you know, <unk> your brains as we look at numbers, faces and forms of snow and forms of snow -- they found that in the friend's champions of the brain, different from others.
In effect, they <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament in <unk> competitive is moving as a armed career where each year comes up with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors should get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
On his desk, I end up with him, there are 36 <unk> from playing <unk> -- which he is about to try to memorize him in an hour, using a technique that he invented and just he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
<unk>
And while there is a huge amount of ways to remember things in these competence, absolutely all the techniques that we used at the end is cut down to one concept that psychologists call <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox.
That's its <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I asked you to <unk> that word I told you a <unk>
So what do you get?
The person who is told that his name is Baker it's unlikely to remember the same word as the person who was told that their job is <unk>
Same word, different capacity of <unk> that's weird.
So what happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
All the other memories they dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They wear white <unk>
They have <unk>
They're going to be good when they come back home to work.
You probably would have some <unk>
And when you take that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> I attended a <unk>
They had hired like entertainment, because before, if I wanted to give a very good party, you didn't take a <unk> <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up, <unk> his memory teacher, and he <unk> and so soon it was left -- the room was <unk>
Let's get all of us all.
But not only killed them all of us, but it ripped down the <unk> bodies.
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So they could not get the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> I was standing outside in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with his eyes of his mind, I could see where he'd been sitting all over here.
I took the family family <unk> where they were their loved ones between the rubble of the rubble to it.
What we have learned at the time is something that we all know more or less <unk> and is that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or numbers of the phone or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial spatial memory.
If I told you that I would get the first 10 words to the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely that you find it very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you asked them to tell me who I was sitting on the horse that was brown and brown in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember -- the more crazy -- <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the image, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to make it of memory, in the same way that I would have done <unk> if you'd invited it to two years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
And that would remember you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then I put in the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a year -- and they have some friends to help them.
This is how the <unk> <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not word -- which is going to confuse it but typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> would be like the first place in his parents' country.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got stuck with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> of <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a boring <unk> event.
Really, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting taking tests. I mean, that the most exciting thing happens is when somebody sits on the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in the place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> school in a <unk> market.
And I found that this was a fun thing.
I would never expect you to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is actually about doing is to improve more and more the ability to create and imagine these images <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of mind.
And I was pretty much hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard <unk> team for memory.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security glasses covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a competitor of memory.
I ended up coming back to the same competition that I had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could put it into a kind of a <unk> experiment.
I thought this might be a good job for my entire research.
The problem was that the experiment was coming out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and phone numbers and <unk> and it is actually not the point.
These are just tricks that are just tricks.
Because it's based on pretty basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> from memory or memorize the <unk> to benefit with some <unk> about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
Great memories <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We find it deeply.
The palace, these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
It makes a kind of profound processing, a kind of complete attention that most of you are not going to go out there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today, is what the <unk> <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, and I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose out of what's already our <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to being human in front of us, who walk on our side -- we will be so <unk> that we didn't even slow down in processing <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person who remembers <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, and so we would just take a <unk> <unk>
Because 30 years ago, I am from <unk> Jersey -- I was six years old, and I lived there at a village of my parents called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And then you all spent the time watching the TV, and so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me and I would come back and come back in a towel, all of me see.
And I was like this.
It was a lot, and I hated it.
I was going to get that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, not about mathematics, or of those connections that are emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that we get.
And it's no wonder that we feel like that, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture tells us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you think about -- you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about it by based on a building that built 2,500 years ago.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional <unk> connection, we've used this trick for a lot, a long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, removed from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> the <unk> and governments, are always afraid to innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the <unk> Public Library that became 2004 in 2004, in my hometown, and you know, you have this <unk> it has this round thing, boom, brick red, that they leave <unk> which is trying to communicate with this <unk> children, the values of property history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, became another library that looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and to share.
So how is it possible in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the <unk>
On one side there is the <unk> the architects constantly drive new technologies new technologies -- new solutions for the current forms of life.
We were going to go and push it so much, we get completely away from people.
And all of the black, this is <unk> you think we feel very good, but we're dead because we don't have another choice.
We have to go to the other side and come back to connect with those symbols <unk>
So we are all happy, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started to experience <unk> we do <unk> <unk> and over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course it is in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago we had the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small at scale.
Something really hard.
So we get to the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
And I put the links back in the other direction.
We take those ways we know and <unk>
It neon and we have to add up and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we turn them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
insane.
But they were the '80s, that was great.
We all spend the time in shopping centers, and we moved to the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those erotic fantasies could be <unk> or French or Italian <unk>
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and all of you know, this is not <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started doing a swing again in the other direction.
In the '80s and in the early 1990s, we started experimenting with what's called <unk>
We have the <unk> symbols now we have with new design techniques, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that would be attached to other forms.
This is an academic and <unk> and <unk> and it's <unk>
Normally the <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, the building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical and the public and the public in general, they were completely aware of a building.
The New York Times <unk> this building of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up in a thousand percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild forms and <unk> how is it possible that they become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media was <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those shapes which means culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The main mayor of the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new development of the new <unk>
I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these very few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually started going through the entire architecture, digital media started increasing the speed of information consumption.
Think about how we consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, I would have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
And shipping is <unk> you can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see on the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all of us are photographers of architecture, and the building is taken beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere. That means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't take a long time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years old, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before I did that I designed about four years ago, it was either successful or not.
Because there's never been good feedback on architecture.
This is how we found ourselves with buildings like this.
The <unk> was not about two years, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to be going back to <unk> Because we are at the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel and steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the media to <unk> it starts to swing faster, until it will be on both extremes almost <unk> and <unk> effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you know, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> <unk> in the state of New York.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant two years before the building would end up the building, it was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked like the final product, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, became a media environment, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you did the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes you <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks telling us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians in <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet to look for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to people, and tell them that there's no single response to what a library might be today.
Let's be part of this.
This is a abundance of solutions that gives freedom of experience.
It's all different now.
Architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that use words <unk> and expensive, and one is no longer a <unk> audience who doesn't accept something that hasn't seen before.
<unk> can listen, and you don't leave it from architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> from one another, from a movement to the other, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> historical <unk> historical brick in ideas that should be a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for ways that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings will join the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a garage parking in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve for a sport or a <unk> or even you can get married in the night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming on the East Coast of New York, and raise half a million dollars of the community united around that cause, no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this small pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how to build what it matters is what we built.
The architects already know how to make the more <unk> and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you guys to want.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give way to the most <unk> spaces, the local libraries the homes where we shape our children, and the step of the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it makes it very typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if your body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things you like to do for the moment is to look at it in the mirror.
She really love her reflection.
It's laughing and <unk> and it gives himself those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me I used to do that, and I thought I used to think, When do I stop doing this?
How is it that we are suddenly not comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> she's 13 years old and it lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, you just want to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little bit embarrassed because although her mom tells him all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, somebody tells him it's ugly.
In the course of what your mom says and what his friends, or your classmates say, you don't know who you believe.
So you make a video of her own, it publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others to please leave a <unk> "I am nice or I'm <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has received more than 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that it's not even worth thinking about them.
We talked about a <unk> and normal <unk> that gets these answers into one of the most vulnerable life stages.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is he doing to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, giving you <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
We have never been so connected, so we have been so connected, in a continuous way, so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures on the hand is <unk>
This environment is always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is true, and what it is as a rigged of it.
What is the greatest thing in somebody's life, in somebody's life, what is normal in a day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the girls of the girls right now.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And <unk> like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who do it, <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture.
It's not hard to look at what young people are.
But the kids are not immune to this.
As the ones of the superheroes of the sport, and the singers, <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow up to be healthy and are individuals.
But in a culture that's obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and mental effort to look at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capability, their studies and other aspects begin to be suffering.
Six in 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see beautiful enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
These are fundamental activities for growth as human beings, and as we interact with society and the business development field.
They are almost 31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the class of class.
One in five are not going to be attending at all for the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the middle season, if you don't think you see good enough, specifically if you don't think you're old enough, <unk> a lower note on the average of your fellow who don't care about how much looks.
And this phenomenon is widespread in Finland, the United States and China.
And it turns out regardless of what these young people.
So, to be clear, of course, we're talking about how you see it, not how you really are.
The low self-esteem on your body is <unk> the academic yield.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with low self-esteem are less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more diet not healthy that you can bring to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and are at greater risk of depression.
And we think that it's all about this for what they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol and by drugs, technological surgery <unk> aesthetic, sex with sex and <unk> and no protection and harm.
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing into the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women, you think they're overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't present a job interview on a day where they don't feel safe with the way you see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be?
It will take this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking, by itself, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms. The first is that we have to nurture trust in your own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the perfect images of perfect images and build their self-worth.
The good news is that there are many available programs to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really amazed when I learned that a lot of a lot of <unk> shows that a lot of <unk> shows that a lot of <unk> <unk> that I was really aware of.
So we have to make sure that the show that our children are going to be not just going to have a positive impact, but also a durable impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family and friends and relationships.
And these six aspects are starting to be critical points for anyone willing to provide an education into body self-esteem than work.
An education is fundamental but dealing with this problem requires each of us to take care on the issue, and let's be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
We really challenging the status of the way women are seen and talked about our circles.
It's not good to tell you with our politicians with the <unk> of <unk> or the size of your <unk> or <unk> that the determination of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a big beauty.
We need to begin to judge people so they are, not as they see.
All of us can start doing that by assuming the responsibility for the kind of images and comments we published in our social networks.
We can engage people based on people based on their effort and their actions not in their appearance.
And let me ask you when it was the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, like governments and companies, to change our culture, so that our children will grow up to valuing their own person, valuing individuality, diversity, the <unk>
We have to put people who are actually making a difference in a <unk>
It's because of making a difference in the real world, let's make them out on the big screen because we can just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where they think that you see that you can see the <unk> of being who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for somebody in their lives.
Who has in mind?
It <unk>
It <unk>
It <unk>
Your <unk> <unk>
Could it be just the woman who is in two car seats. What would it mean for her if he was liberated from that <unk> voice in his interior, he <unk> it by not having long legs -- <unk> more <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were <unk> this and we'd be able to take their potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are <unk> all of us.
But let's get to our kids the truth.
I think the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them because of what they do, and because of how they make us feel.
It sends their self-esteem into the <unk> of our schools.
So let's switch each of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, they will become safe change agents in their own morning.
So let's do it.
On the November five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> went to a hotel in Manhattan and killed to the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense <unk>
By <unk> they initially declared it, but being caught by other charges -- in the company of others, they started planning on attacks in a dozen New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans would be taken by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center could not get away from it.
Later on, they would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a loving mother, high school teacher. In the two they made everything possible for me to give me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, which is very few, including most Muslims come to know about.
For experience I saw that when people take time to interact with not a lot to want to want the same things in life.
However, all of all, in all of the human group -- there is always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that thinks that we have to use all the possible means so that everyone lived as them.
A few months before his arrest he sat up with me and explained that in the last weekends, he and a few friends, had been going on to shoot him in Long Island, in order to practice.
He told me that I would go to him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I touched my father -- my father helped me hold on my shoulder, and he explained to me how to aim for about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot gave the little orange light on the objective and to surprise all of us, especially me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle became the other and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
From such a parent, that child.
All of all, the comment took a lot of laughter, but only a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction, my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned to put a loaded with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground parking lot in the underground parking lot in the north tower of the World Trade Center -- an explosion that killed six people and hurt another 1,000.
I admired those men.
I called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times that instability during my childhood wasn't allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I was starting to feel comfortable about somebody -- it was time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always my new face of the class that was often a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white one, but it will be the new class of class, quiet and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was going on at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't have social skills, to put it <unk> for <unk> <unk> was not prepared for the real world.
They <unk> <unk> to judge people, based on <unk> <unk> like race or religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that put the test for me to think, was during the 2008 presidential elections in 2000.
In a <unk> program, I was involved in the National Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence as I had been the victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
And one day, at the end of the <unk> I found that one of the kids who we had made, friendship, was Jewish age.
It took a lot of days out of the light, and I realized there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud of having defeat the barrier that all life had made me believe that I was <unk>
Another critical moment emerged when I got a summer job, in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures that experience it turned out to the development of my character.
I had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
I happened to have the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics that I had seen in life.
Having been a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people kind, in exactly the way I wish to be treated.
For that feeling I could contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is being <unk> but I know what is being judged by something beyond my control.
Then he came up with <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see that race people's people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with character.
In many ways he became my <unk> figure at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
In occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected and a Jewish comedian had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something I hold in my heart forever, while he's alive.
And she looked at me with the children's eyes of somebody who has suffered enough <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy, you need to keep that hatred on your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope anyone who is trying to bring to violence, you can hear my story and understand that there's a better way, that even though I was given to this ideology and violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and our biases.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, by the dreadful pain and the loss that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism talking against those <unk> acts, to the actions of my father.
With this simplicity I put here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.
At this moment there is a film that is projected in your minds.
It's an amazing movie movie.
It's 3D and it has <unk> sound that you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film is <unk> taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of your childhood that you project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice <unk> in your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths about being human.
Every one of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie of your own, you and tea and you.
There's nothing to make it more directly.
At least I know that I have an awareness of your own.
I don't know that you're aware of you.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we need, what we received to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for consciousness.
The science, for nature, is objective now.
<unk> by nature, is <unk>
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all of the 20th century, I would send that vision.
The psychology was studying behavioral behavior, neuroscience was a <unk> brain, but no one ever mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
We were born like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science to bring the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the time.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of wonderful work that I showed Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of looking at faces or feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations here.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to a few questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real mystery mystery of this <unk> why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all kinds of emerging behaviors -- how do they operate the <unk> how the <unk> are going to adapt and <unk> the living organisms -- all of these are questions about doing objective work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how do we treat it, how we treat <unk> all these questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about the behavior of the <unk>
But the hard problem is the question of why all behavior is accompanied by an out-of-body experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm, the standard paradigm, the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that would work. For a long time, I would hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end of the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a chain of wonderful theory, great. We used to get used to this, physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of.
On the other, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate into our view of the world, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that were able to be able to be able to be able to deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today has one.
Your crazy idea is that there's no such difficult problem of consciousness.
All of the idea of the mathematical movie of the world includes a kind of delusion or confusion.
In fact, what you have to do, is to explain the functions of the brain, the behaviors of the brain, and this is studies all that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness, based on the brain.
At the same time, for me, and for many other others, that vision is pretty close to simply denied that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to be happy.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties are not explaining in terms of any more basic terms.
On the contrary, they look like fundamental and that's about the world.
Sometimes, the list of the key thing is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, mass laws -- so <unk> the basic laws of the <unk> and <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws will be.
I think that's the situation we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas <unk> space, time, <unk> charge, then for a matter of logic, there are <unk>
The most natural would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly is not to be an object of science.
It opens up the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other core concepts -- space time, the mass processes.
<unk> sometimes say that we want fundamental laws such that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This is sometimes called <unk> <unk> all of all, <unk> by mind, each system is aware, not only humans, dogs, mice, flies, even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with heartbreak when you think God, I always go to the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell <unk>
No, no.
But the thinking is that maybe photons can have any kind of raw sense of it -- we will bring it into some basic precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think about something so <unk>
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea, consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental, like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, same as others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea is <unk> it's much less for different cultures where the human mind seems more a continuum to nature.
A more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that we think about thinking about the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Every data processing there is always consciousness.
<unk> of <unk> complex, like in a human, complex consciousness.
<unk> of simple, simple consciousness.
Something very exciting is that in recent years -- a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration called <unk> which measures the amount of information embedded in a system.
And you're supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration -- a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a degree of information integration of information, quite quite significant to consciousness -- quite important.
But when you get to the garden -- microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller -- but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of zero.
It actually raises a fundamental law of <unk> high grade of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate awareness to the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers often have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk about the reality underlying the reality.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where is it coming out of the fire of <unk>
From vision <unk> the equations of physics can be able to leave you are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire on the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not going out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision is, I think, vision <unk> has the potential for <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social social, serious implications.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that I had consciousness, then should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll be very hungry.
I think that I think about it, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms, and the moral <unk> is not both the fact of consciousness, but its complexity.
It's also natural to ask awareness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information <unk> she has a complicated information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious of it.
If this is right, they have a lot of serious ethical problems about the ethical of the development of smart computers and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for collective collective consciousness on the planet.
Canada has their own <unk>
Or at a local level, an integrated group like the audience in a TED talk -- right now we have a great collective consciousness -- an internal movie for this whole whole group of TED <unk> different from the <unk> of every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question you must take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer from the first crazy idea, consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is a fundamental thing that is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right way to a serious awareness.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem in science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it at night at the morning.
But I think we will finally be able to figure out it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village at Victoria.
It had a very normal profile, an underground profile of education.
I went to school, I was obsessed with my friends, my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a community member came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community of the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a saying.
She actually has no anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as an achievement if we take the disability outside of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school school in <unk> school, just after about 20 minutes in the class of <unk> studies, a guy raised his hand, and he said, "Hey, when give you your <unk>
And I said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for about good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When people on the wheels, they talk about things that are <unk> at school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And that's when I realized, this child had had experiences with disabled people like inspiration objects.
And we don't are. And it's not that boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We are there to inspire me.
And in fact, I'm on this stage, I sort of do what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for them to do it. Right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid I am afraid.
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we were lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, they have been sold that disability is something that is <unk>  A capital <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability makes you remarkable to make it remarkable.
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make you <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse be <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a huge amount of them.
It may be you've seen one, from the girl without drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with <unk> legs of carbon.
And there are a lot of these pictures, which are what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the term porn term -- because we had a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, I would encourage the disabled with the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that guy.
But if you're that person?
I have lost the number of times that I've been dealing with strange <unk> to express that I am brave or a source of inspiration and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was kind of like getting up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
So these images, those images are attached to people with disability in benefit from people without disabilities.
They're there for you to see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a tough thing.
So let's make some things.
But the things that we overcome are not the things that you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I joined the so-called social model of disability, which tells us that we're more disabled because of society that we live in that because of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very pleased with him.
It makes the things that I need you to do, and I've learned to get the best of your capability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're just using their bodies by taking out the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says like a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of a lie, because they've been sold that disability makes us exceptional that disability makes us exceptional
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> inspiration and you think, "Oh God, you're not going to be sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all times.
However, I don't know that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> that is a great idea to use a great idea of <unk> to pick up the things that fall over.   <unk> the clever trick on how to load the cell phone on the <unk>
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that they've been sold about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not real, because of the social model of disabilities.
A lot of <unk> before it has never done a <unk>
Court:   <unk> in front of a television screen will not be going to come up with the <unk> for people who are <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a <unk> and <unk> a positive attitude, to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered out of nothing for being in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of people with disability that we are <unk> for the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disability, and I want to live in a world where a boy of 11 degree in a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that their new teacher is a user <unk>
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think you know about it is that it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see that augmented reality and professional football with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answering one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because augmented reality changed our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
They're going to allow you to experience what's a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried to get <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would focus on your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, underneath a helmet and knowing what is running through the game of the <unk> of the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds of us, trying to get them out of all of their being.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
So let's show some videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the shell, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the <unk> practices, because the idea of the <unk> technology is a submarine going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Go.
It's horrible being <unk>
A few times a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is going to be <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of <unk>
You may have realized that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> from <unk> mice, <unk> mice.
Blue <unk> Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like being in the field, but it has nothing to do with <unk>
The fans want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, being your favorite players and asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field of a field <unk>
Or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get <unk> how do we get it to the next <unk>
We took this at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely many of you know it.
The <unk> <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to teach you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, no. I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a Russian roller mountain, for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan of a fan of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before you run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan experience.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball at the bottom of the network?  Or <unk> making a <unk> in <unk>
What will their experience be when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of <unk> <unk>
But this is not actually <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we achieve <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when the <unk> <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So here's a quick refresher on technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> <unk> put a <unk> to his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to get it back.
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more <unk> because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player coming back to their group, and you see their next move they shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that lead in <unk> you won't have to worry about a <unk>
Or you know, the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose games, and they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose you feel like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game.
How would you do that?
Well, a very simple choice would be a camera in every corner of the stadium by having a view of how high people down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information comes to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
evil will have some information <unk>
This is going to take good teams of bad equipment.
So your computer team is going to be as important as your <unk> and analysis data will stop to be just <unk>
Is it also to be <unk> who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that you're the field <unk>
I took the ball and <unk>
They put an open shell out. All of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your Norden bombsight -- that a defense behind you is going to <unk> they don't eat it, but the system of <unk> you will <unk>
It was going to get to the power of protection.
Another <unk> you know that there's an open gun.
They took the <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. But the receptor sees the bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and can change the race.
It takes <unk> catching up and run away.
The general audience and the fans have followed the move from each angle.
This is something that will create massive excitement on the party.
I'm going to make lots of people check it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I wonder is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to encourage empathy between human beings, to show someone what is literally going to be in the other person.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of dollars a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions is from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it is being <unk>
How much is it for a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions we do and the choices we take and the challenges we face -- <unk> as always, as usual.
Thank you.
Recently I was <unk> after 23 years of the service in the <unk> <unk> in California.
Most of those 23 years ago I spent the southern end of the <unk> County that includes the Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known for its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer chief commissioned to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much for <unk>
suicide from the bridge is not practical or <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people think that travel between the two towers will bring them into another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that each of your concerns you get from all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that it happens when the bridge is used for making suicide.
After one every <unk> of four to five seconds, the body hits about 120 miles an hour.
The impact break down the bones, some of which will create life organs.
Most of the majority of the impact.
The ones that don't usually fall into the water <unk> and then <unk>
I don't think that the ones that we have, this method of suicide will be aware of the <unk> the death of the <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches from parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people have been in before they had their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the most dark, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man talked to a officer contemplating his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who would be killed, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new official
This is Jason <unk>
I met him on the July 22 last year when I got a call from a possible subject subject on the cord near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to an official from the Golden <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old, and it had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up to here twice before New Jersey to try to get suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking about an hour talking to us if we knew about the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came up <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
Then Jason asked us, what happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped about <unk> he leaned on the right, and he did.
This kind and smart boy of New Jersey had just gotten out of life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing too well, because the next day, the team of the family called me to see what it was.
The parents of Jason had had a order.
<unk> damage is <unk> to a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family or a friend or somebody loved <unk>
What do you find?
What do you say?
In my experience, not just to talk, but you need to listen.
Listening to understand.
Not <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how to feel it, because you probably don't know it.
You can just be there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think that somebody is <unk> you don't get afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about finishing their life, you've had these <unk>
They were going to be able to take the person in front of the person and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be <unk> <unk> to believe that there's nothing you can do to <unk> social isolation and a lost lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady, and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on January January of this year, and I wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with her permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go foot on the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of feeling that Mike won't come home.
Mike was driving back to San Francisco to San Francisco to see the <unk> of 49 with his father on January <unk>
It never came there.
I called the police <unk> and I was <unk> as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two official came to my house and reported that the <unk> car was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting those who can be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who has not been before not a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk on the way his son took that day, and also the courage to get out of it.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
On March 11 of 2005, I replied to a radio call by a possible subject subject on the sidewalk <unk> in the bridge near the north.
I looked at my shoulder on the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> on the sidewalk.
When he saw me immediately cross the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the time, I heard about as Kevin talked about their depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account to come back to that lane and give life another chance.
When Kevin turned out to it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did it do that he did <unk> and gave life to hope and life <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
I was left talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the <unk> events, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with mental illness for which it's been properly <unk>
I had to send it to Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious from all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know it.
Kevin is in order, like the says.
We give God for you.
<unk> with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writes <unk> When I visited St. San Francisco Hospital that night, you're <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I know I had to get it.
Currently, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of society.
Talk about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story inspire others.
suicide is not just something that I've been found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather will stand up with poison.
That act, despite finishing their own pain, here's the chance to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, they would not think they hurt another person.
They just want your own severe pain.
So usually this is only one of three things: sleep drugs or alcohol or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've answered and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls of suicide around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved in that I've lost only two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
For that time, I was holding my hand at three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
It absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few people who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one one one one or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one that they leave from side to the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't just connect to San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us should be working on to do.
suicide can be prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but inside your inside you know what you are, and a question will tell you, how do you forget about that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone.
When I became a model, I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, I will tell you later later, when I look at this picture, I think, you know, you get it up, and we got it out of it, <unk> it.
But last October, I discovered that I am just getting started.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of <unk> to get rid of the <unk> constraints by the color of the skin or the beliefs around us.
They're people who always challenge the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my agent, I even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this shirt on my head.
And my mom said, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt in <unk>
I said, "Mom, that's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I never let me share my story, not because I think I will be what I'm bad, but because of how the world is all of us who want to be <unk>
Every single day I appreciate being a woman.
I have a mom, my dad and a family who beat me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the <unk> who celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something was <unk> This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the head of a contest of beauty <unk>
That night she said, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she <unk> she was responsible for the <unk> <unk> and he <unk> and that night, I won in <unk> I won in <unk> and she was a third <unk> between over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was from women's beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom. I had moved to San Francisco, he had moved to me and he told me that it passed my request from the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you give America to America you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested me to put my name on my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand at the age of 19, I was also moved.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most sophisticated and safe surgery.
In that time in the U.S., it was necessary to be done before the name of the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's driver's license, and the <unk> <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears looked <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and being a model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living was living his truth, but I was able to put her back to his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of November we do a global <unk> by <unk> Day <unk>
I'm on this stage thanks to a long story of people who <unk> and stood up to injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, at this same moment, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others to live their truth without shame, or fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there are no longer than 20 percent <unk>
My deeper truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you,  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Yeah. <unk> first of all, thank you with all my <unk>
I was in my support network, to my parents especially, to my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and told me to tell me that their parents couldn't take it, and I took my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it works, others don't. It's just gender identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all gave us a gender of birth, and what I try to do is put on the table at the subject that sometimes that task wasn't block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> And this is a conversation we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very polite <unk> Thank you.
In a lot of <unk> and tribal societies, the parents often know about their children, but I am one of the few parents who is known for your daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education by defending their rights in 2007. And when their efforts was <unk> their efforts in 2011, in <unk> the National <unk> National National <unk> <unk> girl.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm your father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in the industrialized societies, right from the beginning, when when I was born a child, their birth is not <unk>
He's not welcome for your father, not for his mother.
The neighborhood comes back, it gives their <unk> to mother and no one left the father.
And a mother had a lot to get a little girl.
When you give birth to the first child, the first child, he gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a child, when he <unk> her third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the suffering, but the daughter's <unk> daughter <unk> when it comes up, he suffers from too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, they get home and the school admits of his brothers.
Until 12 years in a way, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and you can move around the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it is 13 years old, he was a chance to get out of her home without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It turns into the honor of his father and her brothers and her brothers and her family, and if you were to break the code of that <unk> <unk> could even kill.
And it's interesting that this source code of honor, is not only the life of a <unk> also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of their life and happiness of his sisters in the name of the course of the course of honor.
And there's a more rule of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the question.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and accepts the decisions of their father and their mother and the decisions of the <unk> even if they don't want.
If we did it with a man who doesn't like or <unk> with an old man, he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk> <unk>
If the very young man, you have to accept it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and it continues.
I was <unk> brothers and sisters, when <unk> was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I was thinking, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> from <unk> and he called my daughter so for her.
But when I was amazed -- they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years and a half, I was <unk> in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a girl in a school?
Yeah, I should <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in the tribal countries, in tribal societies, is a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
One to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations and aspirations where it can explore potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and no one of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I went to the form of <unk> Canadian and was in the relative to the family, couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason that value to my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
I put it down to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
The <unk> to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I have <unk> all these good values in my school to girls and girls in the way.
I used education for <unk>
I went to my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
They were <unk> brothers and sisters, superstars, for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and particularly for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's involvement in all the political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls would be banned at school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> girls' girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and got up on the right to education.
He wrote a paper for the BBC, of the BBC, he was offered her same for New York Times New York Times, and I talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason the reason the Taliban could not tolerate their campaign and October nine of 2012, <unk> <unk> on my head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and for me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I was terrified of my wife -- "I've got <unk> so I went to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't tell you."
You get the fair cause.
<unk> your life for the cause of peace, because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of peace, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get away.
They both were on the right path and God <unk>
And these few words would spend a lot to me, and I didn't ask you again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe pains and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that would be swallowed by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never was <unk>
I used to say, "I'm good with my smile <unk> and with my face.
I'm going to put it right. Please don't go away.
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
We had a brothers and sisters and sisters, we have learned from it how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any 16-year-old girl.
<unk> when you didn't end his job.
They fight with your siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is especially special in my mentoring who has done so bold to <unk> so courageous and <unk> and <unk>
I mean, I don't ask you what I did.
I didn't do what I didn't do.
It didn't cut out its wings, and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> from the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> -- but all the work I'm talking about here today about the science of the brain, I did it before I join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you lie to an operation of brain.
You're still being like smart or not?
Is it not like that, you can be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what to be able to take to make, from more than a dozen other chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, I would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide to decide about combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to convince them to follow life.
More than once I've been saved by recently.
But luckily, I have a heart soul, so I decided that I will be able to get the dose of <unk> because there is really no clear map that will say in <unk>
I started to test with different <unk> and I was amazed by looking at how small changes in the dose of the <unk> <unk> my sense of who I was like, my sense of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I set up dose and a typical chemical dose for a man to come, and I was surprised to see how I looked at my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some versions of <unk>
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> fixing a problem that had the front, and it was just not going on like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that that experience gave me a new appreciation for men and about what they have to do -- I know that I have been better with men.
What it was trying to do about how to adjust those hormones and those hormones and so on, it was to recover my intelligence after disease and <unk> my creative thought, my creative <unk>
We would think almost always in pictures, and that became my point of key reference, how to get these mental imagery that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> <unk> new ideas.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought the images and mental ideas were the same thing.
There are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind.
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great <unk> mental <unk> really, really sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental imagery of my mind to a computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director would be able to use their imagination only to drive the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way the creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to achieve this is just increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that have been done by two leading groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, an image of functional MRI, to represent the brain, and you can see the brain scan made by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left is the scanning of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The middle column shows the scanning of the brain of that same individual as you were <unk> seeing that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the content of the upper column on the left, you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into visual <unk>
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos, while they were <unk> their brains to create a big pool of reactions in the brain in the video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images -- new people, new animals, and as long as they were <unk> a new <unk>
The computer, using just brain information is <unk> to show what it looks like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're close to doing that.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember that when you see an image, and when you imagine that same picture, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This is been done with the brain scanning systems of larger resolution, available today, and its resolution to a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you get it?
There are many techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many are proposing new techniques of projection for images, even me, <unk> with the recent outcome of the MRI -- first we need to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the way we have the end of the road.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> only provide small improvements in the resolution, does not increase a thousand as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of larger magnets make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different things, like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort in MRI were to make really big magnets -- right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of clever and brilliant solutions on coding and <unk> in the radios and radio receivers in MRI systems.
At the time, instead of a magnetic field of <unk> magnetic field patterns held structured to radio frequencies <unk>
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio frequencies of radio radio frequencies we can actually increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split into layers of our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood fluid, but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and maybe even neural activity directly. This is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas directly into the digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move over the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is something big.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool, could take the cancer cure and similar disease.
We have a few more choices to open up this door.
Anyway, they choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay achievement.
I think we all have <unk>
His closet maybe I'll tell you some person for the first time you love it or tell somebody who's pregnant, or tell somebody who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have to do in life.
It's all a hard conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of they've lived in and out there is a universal thing.
Day fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side of the South Side -- I was working on a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, <unk> <unk> like a <unk>
And I'm going to be the slope of the <unk> of my <unk> and I had <unk> my head -- I would ask for a little kid -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would be uncomfortable at the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, it would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother was released a cold, look at his son.
But I would never say anything, and I went through it.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a boy between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight with.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that the next time I would say something.
I should have that difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A familiar silence, but this time I was prepared to come up with the female issues on the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a snippet of the "Vagina Monologues," I would <unk>
So I just took it down and I went down the look and my back, a four year-old girl with a pink dress -- looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "You're a boy or <unk>
And so I just took it back to it, again, I got <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is confusing to me.
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw a child, and I am a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a dancing pajamas.
Now, I'm more than a girl from a ninja pajamas.
And that girl looked at me by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all about it.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the easiest conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> Because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the darkness, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how a feeling feels like a <unk>
This is how my closet is not different from you or your tea or your tea or your own.
<unk> will give you a hundred reasons why we get out of my closet, it was harder than getting out of it, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to somebody who have declared on online banking is harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder than saying to your five year-old son who you're going to <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there is just the hard thing.
We need to stop looking at what's hard to be difficult about how it is hard to make you feel better or worse relative to our senses, and we need to just feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than what the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are made is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse <unk> a dress and shoes <unk>
It wasn't the militant lesbian who had been prepared to fight any four year-old boy who would go into coffee.
I was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet.
My family, my whole friends that I've spent my whole life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was turned around to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> to kill you.
One of my most memorable post was on my sister.
It was the first time that many of them invited them to be gay, and by making my <unk> <unk> and my <unk> <unk> and <unk> walked around the tables and finally got to one where the friends of my parents, people who were known to me.
And after talking about a moment, one of the women Homer <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program Will Will <unk>
And you know who makes us <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but wait for desperately to show her support, to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that we get.
That's how hard conversations continue to be my strong point.
Ask anyone who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I still like to call the three principles of Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay <unk> but understand that what it means to get out of the closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl at coffee had no armor but I was ready for the struggle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the others must know we also suffer.
Number two: Be accurate, just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If you tell their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
They don't give them a sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate their truth.
They would never get out of that.
And some of you can get wounded hurt by what they've done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yeah, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that something in them, not you.
Those are the expectations of what you are, but not his.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find out in a dark closet.
And you might feel very good by yourself, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has seen a very famous place of <unk> quote that "The question of if a machine can think about as interesting as the question of whether an underwater question is <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical set of computer pioneers like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I would take a program to try to understand the underlying fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step back.
First let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from a alien race that you don't know about the biology of Earth or neuroscience of Earth or intelligence of Earth -- but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're in a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that doesn't have any concept of intelligence on Earth, they would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, even at a certain point in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet would stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I did several years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I believe, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately correlated for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that will promote the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the robotic movement, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, taking all of these different issues and <unk> together, I asked them, I said, there's an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
Is there just an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I ever saw.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a force -- frequency that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action or keep the open choices with a force T, with the diversity of possible future <unk> Yes, even an impending time of the future <unk>
In <unk> words, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain the open.
And so, having this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
It was <unk> the human <unk>
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a clip I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> in their life should have to have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings, like us.
But what if that <unk> connection, <unk> between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually emerges directly from her?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of the long-term entropy of any system in which you can find it.
Amazingly, <unk> could be multiple animal testing, play animal games, and even make money <unk> actions, all of it without being done to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a single one of a single foot <unk> here we see <unk> automatically <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided for his <unk> <unk> <unk>
This skill of equilibrium will have applications for <unk> robotics and human technology.
This capacity of tools will have applications of intelligent manufacturing applications and agriculture.
In addition, like some other animals can cooperate throwing up opposite of a rope from a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For instance, here you see you successfully play a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly <unk> and keeps success on the world well connected.
This same <unk> capacity also has apps on health care and intelligence and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organize the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to extend the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable into defense and logistics and transportation.
And finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of trying to be successfully increasing the assets under their climate management environment.
This ability for risk will have broad applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of marks of cognitive cognitive behaviors such as the tools of tools, walk upright and social cooperation -- all derived from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back at the beginning of the term term -- the <unk> work, there was always the concept that if you were going to make smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion, in the way.
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all of these decades, we have had all of the concept of rebellion, in the other way.
It's not the machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, the impulse to take the control of all the future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that intelligence can actually arise out directly to take control, rather than being upside down.
Another important consequence is searching for the goal.
They often ask me, how do you look for targets learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to move to the descendants of them to help them build artificial artificial or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: The intelligence must be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid restrictions on their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've radically expanded our knowledge of how the Earth works in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission mission has found thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one between billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope, which measures the acoustic intensity intensity of stars, when the planets go ahead of them, and they blocking a little bit of that light that will get to us.
The data collected by Kepler shows the size of the planets besides the distance that there are between them and their star star.
In together, this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their suns.
In turn, this gives you clues about whether these planets we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we're finding this trove of potentially <unk> worlds -- our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the hottest record.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for us for millennia now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that have caused global scale have <unk> our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a weather scientist or <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
I could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as somebody who is very interested in finding life in the universe in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, most enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites up to a comparison between the planet and the planets that we know better: our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a <unk> world that has been able to be done by a mission like the <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and partly that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> track its surface to search for clues about the origins of life as well as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> <unk> take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies now offer not only short flights but also the <unk> of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images are <unk> we remind the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still stay in <unk> places compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and highest places on Earth the air is cool and teeming with its tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this kind of excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets will lead to a great and sad part: implication and belief that Mars would expect there to save this <unk> <unk> the only planet that we know is truly livable Earth.
For a lot that I like the exploration, I am in deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there for <unk> to humanity is like figuring out that the captain of Titanic will tell you that the <unk> will actually have place later on the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for exploration, and the Earth preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They get closer to the house.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of the ground, we may be able to meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment with an experiment, the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked, did I know that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found some evidence of life existence until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the gender paradox is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to be living between stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that we use this development.
It's <unk> to think that only the colonization we will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and evolutionary exploration.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments on Mars for the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own house.
And as I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized he didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table of the dining table where there were <unk>
So fast I tried to open all the other doors and windows and all of them were closed.
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get it, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend a night because I had an early flight to Europe in the morning, and I was <unk> from my passport and <unk>
<unk> expensive, but sure that there is no longer expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, although in the circumstances, I thought, although in the circumstances, I was going to be stuck.
I'm a <unk> a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> who increases heart rate -- we will remove the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thought.
And when I came to the counter of <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that could put in their place, that <unk> that was bad things.
Or at least if you get bad things that will be given the probability of a total <unk>
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts did not exist.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> winning the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed to talk about the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called a retrospective <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written from this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come out and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you try to find out all of the things that could go wrong, then tries to figure out what can do to prevent things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the shape of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, you get a place for things that are <unk>
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make track of the location of the important things, where the fish are, where the fish are located in the <unk> trees, where the tribes live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that is <unk> in London in London.
It's the part of the brain that lets the <unk> find their nuts.
And if you wonder if somebody actually did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing your car, reading reading and <unk>
So at home, I <unk> a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular feeling.
For your reading reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they're <unk> with it your things will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit cards of drive, passport, <unk> by email themselves so you're in the cloud.
If these things are lost or the <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we'll not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful situation than when you're facing a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved self, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all of medical decisions, and in fact for social decisions and social choices, any kind of decision that you need to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the physician says, "I've received the <unk> and <unk> <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, attack a brain injury.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may already hear about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> medications in the world today, it's even likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistic that you should ask that most doctors don't want to talk, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to be having surgery on any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you must think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number has to be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if not to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's <unk> it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood the mechanisms that are <unk>
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs work only is 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number required to treat the most widely <unk> which you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you can help someone help somebody help us.
300.
This is the research of the research researchers who have <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I explored the numbers.
300 people have to take a drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, a brain stroke or another event.
Now you might think, "Well, one probability of 300 to go down my <unk>
Why do not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody <unk>
But then you have to ask for one more statistic -- and it is, <unk> from the <unk>
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in five percent of patients.
And those include things that are <unk> <unk> muscle pain.
But a moment.
Remember that under stress, you don't think clearly.
So think about how you look at this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of thinking about the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 and the side effects, that are 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to go out <unk> for the drug that the drug can help you.
I don't say they should or not take the <unk>
I'm just saying that you must have this conversation with your physician.
The medical ethic is required, it's part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have a right to get access to this kind of information to initiate the conversation about whether you want to take risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the crash, of the crash, but actually this number you need to try is pretty typical.
For the surgery that is actually done in the older men in the 1950s, <unk> of prostate cancer, the number you need to deal with is <unk>
This is what it is, 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, are being produced in 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think about the question of time -- the questions that you can ask is to bring the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice a lot of times, they want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that time is that you shut up a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> face with a predator -- you don't need the <unk> system, or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending metabolism in those things, it doesn't react to be lunch -- you could get the lunch of the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thinking like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to get them to think about the future to this kind of situation.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail at a while.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help to minimize harm, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
They went down to the night of snow in <unk> when I went back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination with the door, with a key to the gate of the gate in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have a lot of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of text messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite music.
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're touching a musical instrument, you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch more <unk>
Two <unk> even more smooth.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there, you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be -- you never have a complete silence.
That's my definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French sign language came up for the decade of 1800, and over the time it was mixed with local, and it developed with the language that we know about as a <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, now I realize that it's not true for anything.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, they're actually in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a world of sound, it's as if I lived in a foreign country, following their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms of <unk>
So how do you understand the sound work?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned, for example ...
"You don't know the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of potato chips.
Don't you <unk> and when you're eating, you're not going to be covered in the <unk>
All of this is called <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound that's going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk>
Let's move it down to continue.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to the sound.
This is the sign to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, doing it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I just have four lines on paper.
In 2008, I had a chance to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic house, there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
For this summer, I visited museums and different spaces of <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized there were no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the tendency and that was called me <unk>
There were no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has come into my territory of art.
Is it going to make me <unk> more of the art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like that.
I actually know the sound.
I know it so well that it's not only experiences through the ears.
I can feel this <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that had been taught to me as sound, I decided to leave and <unk>
I started to create a new job.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck with how many support and attention I had.
I realized that sound is like money, power <unk> social currency, social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was something like a listener.
And sound is so powerful that I could take it back to me and my art work, or I could <unk>
I chose to make me angry.
There's a massive culture around the speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me like and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, at work and institutions, I work with many different performers in <unk>
And its voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, at asking <unk> their voices, I am able to keep a temporary form of value as well as to take a loan on a very high interest rate.
If you won't continue with this practice, I feel like I could put it in the <unk> and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note, you can't capture and expressing fully on paper.
And the same is true of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the things like the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you can understand how <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide up in many different parameters themselves.
If you put a different parameter different from every finger while you touch the piano, like facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of your hand, and like that, while the piano, the English is a linear language, like <unk> just a button at the time.
However, <unk> is more like a chord -- you need the 10 fingers in a place to express a concept of clear or idea of <unk>
If just a key, to change the chord would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing about music in terms of it, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters, <unk> you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the <unk> sign in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I am <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see <unk> through the <unk>
If I had to create a sign and I would put it over and over again, it might be like a piece of visual music.
For instance, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is <unk>
If you look at it, and you remove the speed, visually speed, looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be called <unk> <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This is how they express time in <unk> and how long the body can express changes in time.
For instance, one <unk> is one hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present is closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last thing that is my favorite, with a very romantic idea and dramatic and dramatic and dramatic at the same time at the same time.
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically <unk>
Watch <unk> hand right -- <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to teach you a shape of the hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands in high.
Now we're going to do it both in my head like my chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> the same time."
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third. Please jump back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
And look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and your chest. But they bring very different meanings,
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive, and thriving just like the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't really have sound, it doesn't automatically have social value.
We have to start questioning what it defines social value and allowing the <unk> to grow its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step for a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> not to learn to learn music.
<unk> is a treasure trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to <unk> to open your ears open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents said, "Can you <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
That freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a innocence, or a bubble bubble -- I should say, because adults would lie to us from the horrible truth.
When I was growing up, I found out that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good at <unk>
The time happened, I'm now an adult and team and invention in the <unk> school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk through the beach in <unk> with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of scary.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive to use those giant boats too.
So along with my students, ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> work for the kids to be able to be able to participate.
And I'll tell you the kids who are using electric tools feel great and secure.
Not exactly.
So let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce it to the size that we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every child and try to adapt it into something that we expect to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids would get a lot with the robots.
We create rapidly what we call "a <unk>
We are so fast at creating prototypes that we ended up before not lunch.
And we turned out a light lamps and the web cameras on accessories. And we put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating down through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I took this step-by-step invention on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that somebody would get it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they're trying to get the solution immediately.
I'm going to ask myself to investigate my problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well informed.
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and it's <unk> with this image:
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning an oil spill, just using the hands of the hands in <unk> the world's greatest <unk> of the world in Bangladesh.
They were really surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is <unk> the water where you live.
You can also see that the water is brown, the mud and the oil are also <unk> and the oil is also <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> that allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> which can be <unk> through all kinds of chemicals that produce different <unk> which can be able to identify what's in the water.
We brought this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help form other children.
I was forced to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit more far away, maybe tackling a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and <unk> and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> several cities on the East Coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power close to the water.
And today, according to the reports on an average of 300 tons -- still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution per <unk>
If we go to the West Coast, we can measure radiation <unk> everywhere.
But if you look on the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, it has to be very safe and it's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've come back to <unk> every year from the accident and research independently with other scientists, land -- and we wanted to take the children.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't get it.
But every night we went to the center of <unk> here you see a different use of <unk>
It might seem like they didn't take the serious work but they did it because they're going to have to live with <unk> his whole life.
Along with them, we discuss the data <unk> that day and talk about what we were going to do next, strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a map <unk> <unk> of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> philosophies to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate rain.
So with this we could notice that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system, and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this we organized an civil crime, the closest to the nuclear center to the date.
We get closer to a 1.5 miles of nuclear station, and with the fishing help of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> of sediment as we invented and built.
Here's a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit small therefore, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the largest space and dedicated environmental and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, of optical optical -- basically you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of kids can become reality with the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> we asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in mobility of the elderly population transforming their chair chairs into new self-driving cars.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave to our kids are the lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, citizens scientists, creators, we need to prepare the next generation to worry about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of overall design.
One is made of thousands of steel parts, the other one of a <unk>
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is <unk> on the environment, the other one believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the subway.
The <unk> was a tool of Michelangelo.
But the living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all of the information that required for each cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> and manufacturing and mass production.
The lines of <unk> have dictated a world made of parts, including the imagination and designers and trained architects to think of their objects as <unk> from different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> pores themselves.
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
One acts mostly like filter, the other mainly like barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a split screen that represents my vision of the world -- the double personality of every designer and an architect to work between the <unk> and the gene between the machine and the organism, between assembly and growth, between the assembly and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left brain, and the law, and analytics and synthesis, it shows in the two screens after me.
My job at its simplest level, tries to unite these two visions of the world, moving away from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask, why now?
Why wasn't it possible for this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where four disciplines are offered to designers that offers access to the tools that we never had access before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I thought.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, structures and tools through large-scale scales, such as this robotic arm in diameter with a basis of 24 meters on the basis of a very far basis that one day is not very far to print and print buildings made of <unk> genetically engineered buildings, which glow <unk> genetically engineered <unk>
Here we have <unk> an archetype of ancient architecture and has created a screen where every aperture is only size to model the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It's like a second skin made of one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with a 3D printing program, we print this layer and 3D <unk> in the cells. I will show you more objects like that.
This helmet combine rigid materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner <unk>
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and to the <unk> instruments, to design products that are <unk> not only the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair a chair at the very comfortable structural and also absorb sound.
Professor <unk> my collaborator, came back to nature to <unk> and in designing this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
We have this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, including the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, varies its functionality not by addition to the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There's no parts of nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious house, but when I was young, my grandmother told me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came up and get to define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> <unk>
For that first tree, there would be no difference between trunk, twigs, leaves and <unk>
All the tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land made up to grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask, "What would design be if the objects were made of a single part?
Let's get a better state of <unk>
So we look for the material to take the material into the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruit and we found it.
The second <unk> more abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year because of <unk> crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could tune into your properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> legal.  We were asking them a bunch of husks of <unk> the <unk> and produced toothpaste.
We use chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures built up a system with multiple fog <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could change the properties of the material on the march and create these made structures made of a single material, 100 percent of them.
When the parts are ready, you can dry it down to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why are we designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process used to contain <unk> <unk> that first came up on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria designed to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition with no problems with <unk> and <unk> and if it broadens even more to windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of shrimp <unk> in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part: for objects designed to be put in the sea, <unk> life <unk> and placed on the ground, they'll grow up a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes, to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we have to master bacteria and control its flow.
So like the <unk> <unk> we did our own <unk> <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> and <unk> new biological opinions within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We put our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops.
In our first piece of clothes, they were <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
She lives in our oceans and the <unk> of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
It turns the light into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produce useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms, don't interact in nature.
In fact, it's never been <unk>
They're here designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like <unk> tract <unk> that will help you build these bacteria and to make it <unk> its function of path.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to <unk> performance.
If we wanted more <unk> we get more transparent channels to it.
This makes your digestive system <unk> when you stretch from one end to the other, it's 60 feet.
This is half of the length of a football field -- and 10 times more than our naked <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life within your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the material to be.
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the Muslim tissue, and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this a material thing.
So you always have to come back to nature.
So for now, you know that a 3D printer is printing in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do it like this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture.
The manufacturing is not going on to this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but of two different proteins in different <unk>
One acts like structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, you put those fibers in each other.
And this is happening across scales.
The silk worm goes on in the environment, it creates a tension structure, and then it starts <unk> a cocoon of compression.
<unk> and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
With the end of understanding how this complex process works, we stick a small magnet on the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the silk of the silk worm.
However, when we put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that you would take a smooth, flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different places, different <unk> and we've found that the shape -- the composition, the structure of the <unk> <unk> directly through the environment.
It often <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape the raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
It <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we got this process to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk, and we put us on our site.
We knew that <unk> silk worms to more dark and dark areas that we use a solar path diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, it will produce silk worms on the structure.
We were prepared to get the <unk>
We were asking for silk and <unk> silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to meet us.
We put them carefully at the bottom on the bottom of the <unk> and as you were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much smaller.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
By <unk> silk silk on silk -- <unk> <unk> all this pavilion its integrity.
And in a little over two or three weeks, you know, <unk> silk <unk> <unk> miles.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to give the products and the buildings around us, to form a two material ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, that takes us from a design inspired by nature to an nature inspired by the design inspired by us, for the first time, that we do in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever wondered "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they first did this for the first time.
You can <unk> with your toes.
Three. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask it, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and developed websites, but he was playing the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist all anyway, having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, gets to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I'm going to tell you about something else, something totally different, and I'm going to be excited about it, and I'm going to be <unk> and I feel <unk> I found <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of <unk> for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing to deny all of my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason why I made a lot of anxiety made me so much more <unk>
I was worried that there would be something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for nothing.
I was worried about to be afraid of commitment, or being dispersed, or to <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to ask you to have asked me then.
It <unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I will tell you where they <unk> they learned about culture.
So what do you want to do is what you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is, nobody cares about what I was going to do?"
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
They had the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is a question about and again as you grow in a different way, <unk> to high school students, are asked to ask them to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's about being the beautiful exercise before it is the beautiful exercise of the way that we can remove the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspire kids to dream of what might be, it's not inspired to dream of everything you might be.
In fact, it does right the contrary, because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adults are perhaps <unk> and say, "Oh, how nice, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> a teacher and creative director.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The sense of life is <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real calling the idea that each of us has something to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up their curiosity and many different things that you want to do?
There is no place for somebody in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And I feel like there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
It's a breath for that.
Could it help if you divide up on three <unk> multiple potential <unk>
You can also use other terms that we would look at the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
In the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was who I was very <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us like <unk>
It takes any term that you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as limitation or woe you must win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there is huge strengths to be in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis synthesis is.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creation of something new in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, traveling and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company who creates jewelry <unk>
At <unk> and Rachel came up with this single idea of its <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
That's the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower, <unk> is learning fast.
When we were <unk> we are <unk>
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of testing new things and come out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned to each new area that we have, so we rarely start to zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> at the full time and an independent <unk>
As a child pianist -- an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before I become a writer, <unk> was financial <unk>
It had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when they started their thumb, and this ability helps to write compelling message for the editors.
<unk> it is a loss of time to go to what you're going to be like, even if you get it wrong.
Is it possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is the adaptability. I mean, the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of a videos, other websites, sometimes consultant on Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take diverse <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
The magazine Company Company as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be <unk> to meet the needs of the market, the ones that are really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be missing if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
And <unk> knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep into ideas, and the <unk> offers a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design life and careers that are connected to how we're connected to how we're connected.
And, unfortunately, to the <unk> in a large part of them being told to be more like their fellow <unk>
And once I said that, if there's one thing you take from this talk, I hope that it's this: <unk> with inner currents, whatever it is.
If you are a heart heart, then you can take it through all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those you just realize being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Follow your curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> intersections.
It takes our inner wiring into a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, we have the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman called <unk> they brought her to a psychiatric facility.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until it was still passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> performed a <unk> and found strange <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> brain, of a guy who had never seen before.
But even more surprising, even more surprising, though.
I would have been living today, we couldn't give her more aid than he <unk> he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in getting a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has moved a lot.
We've been discovered and antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> many treatments for cancer, life-saving for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But you have been making progress in treating Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million all around the world.
But by 2050, by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you wait to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that it is going to pass their years with Alzheimer's disease or helping care of a friend or want to be treated with Alzheimer's disease.
In America, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical assistance is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs to increase a five-minute rise in the year 2050, as the generation of the <unk> booms <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's disease is one of the biggest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little done to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't be able to cure or cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's disease than other diseases we do because we've invested less time and money on the research of it.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's disease despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes an annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what people know, people know, but the whole world, Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of us, all of the scientists, all the scientists with aging.
We think that will become <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain compared to an Alzheimer's patient to see the physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger severe loss of memory and mental skills, damage to the brain is caused by Alzheimer's disease that is significantly deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and weird <unk> in the brain of <unk> a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We now know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper it folds up as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds out, these dots are <unk> they end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points are going on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules go <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University, trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what happened to block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
You can do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step of the <unk> and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, most of the wires have reduced the cables and waiting for the best.
But now there are a diverse group of people, physicians, biologists, <unk> physical <unk> and engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that they block specifically this step to stop disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened to test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have a protein molecules that are stuck with each other within them, like humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms in an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just an initial result, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's disease is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to defeat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to convince you that Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and that if we get it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry and <unk>
That was essential to move forward into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the causal victims of their loved ones -- day and night, are often too excited to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
There are 40 million patients today like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking to them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
And I used this article in the column in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall from somebody, I do this.
The paper is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience of my own experience of the last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: Two strangers are <unk> to be 36 questions, and then they both look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number three: If you could wake up tomorrow with an quality or skill, which would be?
Number four: When did it be the last time you get to another person?
And <unk>
<unk> are <unk> these are increasingly personal and more personal.
Number <unk> <unk> actually <unk> me to your partner what you like to or her or her -- I know that I know very truthful this time, and I gave things that you don't say to somebody you have ever known.
When I came up with this studio a few years ago, a really detail really struck me, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited everything from the lab to <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course I was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this study, with somebody who I knew not particularly well, I didn't expect <unk>
But we had no time, and  And I thought it was a good story, so I send him to the column that are a good story later.
That was published in January, and now it's <unk> so I guess some of you are probably asking some of you are probably asking yourself to get together.
And the reason I think you challenge this is because they've been asked by this question again and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
A week before I published the article was really nervous.
I had been working on a very romantic book in the last few years, so I had forced myself to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog blog can get to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would be probably a few thousands of views.
And that came up with a good charge of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The paper was published on a Friday night, and then Saturday, this was on my blog from my blog.
And on Sunday, I had called the "Today Show and Good <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million pages, and I was, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage trust writing that I think about own <unk> experience, but another thing is to discover that someone's love life has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or I had a <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they were all doing the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search on the mailbox to my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and weird strangers, like this.
I was interviewed by radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman used to onstage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately fell red.
I think this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the <unk>
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times was published a <unk> article for San <unk> who included the <unk> experiences by testing the studio in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all of this attention was really <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not every request that we both did a public emergence together.
<unk> TV and <unk> the pictures of pictures of us two.
I think I was afraid to become a fear of becoming the icons of <unk> the <unk> process, a range of that I didn't feel at absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study works, they wanted to know if you really wanted to know if I was able to produce <unk> love, not just an adventure, but love <unk> love.
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just about a few months, and I felt, most people posed the wrong question.
How do you know if we were going to go together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would do the experience of making these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first of these questions in this particular study in 1997. And there, the research project was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking to encourage interpersonal approach, between college students, using what he was doing, called <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants were closer to do it more close after doing that, several later studies, also used protocol <unk> <unk> <unk> as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between members of the police and community used for the community. And they've used it between people of the opposite policies.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, that I took personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, Do you want to say that you get out of the person who you do it."
Well he did a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they can get better better than testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I came up with the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a completely difficult separation here.
I had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to have all of my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or I could live without it.
So I took back to science.
And so I did everything I could find on the science of romantic love, and I was expecting that to be a certain way to take your heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just did for the book that I was writing for, in retrospect, seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was excited about the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I felt back then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in a different way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I look at.
But I can also see you more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably to demand me.
What I'm looking for is a surgeon, not just to be <unk> today, and it's going to be <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to continue to be <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people tried to know when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story was told about 36 questions that there can be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to be able to mitigate some of the <unk> risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because in love you feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we are very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story that says, still follow together?
And its content with an answer. or No.
So more than a question, let me ask you to ask more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relations or even more, how do you live with doubt <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love somebody.
So if you want the short version of the story of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are still following together, and I'm very <unk>
But they fall in love with not the same thing that will remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. The love didn't happen.
They had fallen in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of reading it now, not because it is not true, but because at the time, I had no idea what that choice was about.
It didn't think how many times we would make that decision, and how much times I will keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want you to be enough enough to have done and say, 36 questions, have chosen to love somebody as generous, kind of fun and fun and having expressed that choice in the largest U.S.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what I would expect, and what maybe spending my life searching is that that myth is true.
I want the happy end to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I actually didn't written.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love somebody, and the hope that he also love, and it's scary, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by flying <unk> and in a way, I came up with a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York makes a long time.  Something that really affected me but more more detail on the city of New York ago.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
So I took a wooden box and <unk> a dollar, <unk> a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some <unk> or a few aliens aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species, ideas, for example, how we eat the <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment that I was at <unk> <unk> like to go from <unk> and <unk> and all those things, and I was doing a collage of my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> that Agnes did, I covered it and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more unemployment on the canvas, thinking he could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite: in any way it seemed to grow up of size, as if it was to take the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, strange frogs that was going to find out on the street, all I could find, because I was looking at things my whole life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can pull it up, draw the same as a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I took out the objects and I created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, you will be able to get an idea.
Then I did some insects and strange creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making a little bit of money, to take my girlfriend at dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was great.
At some point, I became interested in the human form, sculptures of generate a natural size of human beings in the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because she was going to kill it.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing in a window, and then another window window, and I had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work was very big -- I call it <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
It's 20 feet long.
It has double <unk> so it's 10 feet of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals are moving between two worlds.
They're going out of the world of representation, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> where they were <unk>
This is where creatures with animals are headed to the <unk> ready to get suicide on the ocean.
The ocean is made of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god strapped to a <unk>
Billy Graham lies in <unk> The <unk> the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, are all kinds of rare things that you can find if you look at the ocean.
But anyway, a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand is coming back.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a look at <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand in which I <unk>
And then when you go to the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it spits out of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail, a <unk> tail that unites the <unk>
Anyway, its tail turn on <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why I did that.
Things I go on, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> made of cards from 1986.
They've been <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
It brings me to my time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material and material will be deployed by dictionaries or magazines.
But each one of them acts as a kind of a file in a form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's getting years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1,300 pounds with a human being stuck inside.
This has a small cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest of the <unk>
There is a waterfall for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you cover the penis or the <unk> or whatever it has to do, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick refresher of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a <unk> body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come out in the head of this strange statue
There's a small forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
They can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there's a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a musician, a <unk> a museum, a <unk> a museum, a school, an editorial arm, which spreads all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
<unk> the box and all of the people inside hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box in which you're living on.
And together we got to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of the countries, from the borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all really made of the same matter and the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with <unk> and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when they hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against the pain, the <unk> and the <unk> and other organs.
And I'll take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug would make any effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When they take drugs that are <unk> they can decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the heart of cells.
But they are also known as their side effects <unk> in its own negative, because in the time that it takes it to the blood <unk> it will be <unk> and worse in the time that it takes it to their destiny, which is where most importantly, in the HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph node the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of patients that will be transferred to the regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a lifetime treatment for life run by its oral <unk>
One day, I sat up, and I thought, "We can get treatment directly into the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for caring and <unk> surgery and diabetes -- you can be used for anything <unk> including hunting transport for drugs.
In fact, we're using pulses of lasers to open up or drill into extremely small holes, which open and closing almost immediately cells infected with HIV to introduce the medication.
The best people say, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little bit powerful and powerful beam about the cellular membrane on HIV as these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, as the cell absorbs the drug into a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro technology or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is it that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a device of three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head -- which is a camera, it's headed to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases directly into the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep open cells.
Well, this doesn't look a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is a dream of every research researcher, in our case, a laser treatment in our case.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've looked at armed groups, not <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
You know, what these groups do when they're not shoot <unk>
My goal is to understand these agents of violence in violence and study ways to encourage violent participation from violent involvement to violent <unk>
I work in the field work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost everything in course, because the war has changed.
I used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors.
For instance, of the <unk> peace deals with 1975 and 2011, <unk> signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we have to understand these <unk> we even need to be <unk> or <unk> in any kind of resolution of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We have to know what these organizations.
We know so well the reasons why they do it, but nobody analyzes what they do when they didn't <unk>
The armed struggle and the policies were <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For instance, the <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a social services network and a military device.
In the same way, Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> in Gaza since 2007.
So these groups do more than just to fire to it.
They're multitasking
We have a complex machine machine, stations of radio channels on television, websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine, in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising meal, but through <unk> business -- for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funding, to recruit better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population by investing in social services.
They build schools, run by hospitals, put in professional <unk> programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
The armed groups also try to conquer the population by offering something that the state is not <unk> security and protection.
The rise of Taliban in an Afghanistan destroyed by war or even the first <unk> of the ascent of <unk> can also be able to look at the efforts of these groups for security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an overlooked price for the population.
But in general, you can provide social services that means filling a vacuum, a gap <unk> through government, and it allows them to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 from Palestinian Hamas can't be able to understand the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill <unk> gaps by government, and they come up with them as armed and political groups, involved in nonviolent struggle and they give governance.
And the more complex and more sophisticated these organizations are these organizations, we can <unk> as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
They got part of a territory, you run all of its function, collected the trash, run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is it <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, <unk> nations and hybrids and the more weak the states, like in the Middle East -- the more injury and fill that gap the actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in military tools.
<unk> that government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and <unk> peace.
If we understand better at groups -- we will better understand what incentives will offer to foster violence from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors, actors, military power can win some fights, but not giving us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill out that safe security to fill that empty government that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a woman, like a woman, and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the tag on <unk> that would be unfair for <unk>
I am <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I was <unk> as a bad feminist.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews -- people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what it started like a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me take a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women who are <unk> <unk> with men and that <unk> sex. Like if that was something bad.
Today, I see what women are treated with women around the world and anger, in particular, it seems a perfectly reasonable question.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that might be a feminist.
Being labeled a feminist was a <unk> a word <unk>
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who is asking too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman, until you realize that it's actually that woman, and you can't imagine being another person.
Eventually, as I was growing up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, feminist, and also, proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
Do you know the same paycheck for the same job.
We have the right to travel around the world like <unk> free or violence.
We have a right to use it so easy and accessible to the contraceptives and the services <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for checks or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, we have to get into account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, skills and much more.
We have to get into account these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> ours is not nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear, I'm a mess.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I listen to rap music at all volume.
Although the letter degrades the <unk> and this is deeply, and the classic <unk> <unk> of the Y, yang <unk> is incredible.
<unk> reality with your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely excited about my musical music.
I firmly believe in the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  all of the <unk> tasks, but also kill insects, the collection of <unk> and the <unk> and the nest <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from the fashion magazines and the beautiful things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies from the fairy tales that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
Let's get this problem.
It comes to the feminism feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women in color, the gay workers, gay workers, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> women.
Listen, if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad guy.
It also goes on this: <unk> feeling a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put feminists <unk> in a <unk>
We expect it to be aware of perfection.
So when we get to them, we have a lot of taste from the same <unk> where <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think of that <unk> before I try to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders and leaders are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They have a fear of standing up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> fear of what that tag means for fear of not being able to do with a little realistic expectations.
Take an example of <unk> or like I call it.
In the last few years it's a feminist feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music <unk> from 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> looking at this star star embrace it properly, feminism and to know women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics begin in endless arguments if it was not a feminist.
It takes their feminism, rather than just believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot, we need a lot.
We're going to go far beyond the sane <unk> and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or more good, feminism feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give up the action and be a little bit more <unk>
If I hear music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy to provide a supply supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change will effectively affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does their music be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions do this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, gender equality that we all deserve and it's our responsibility.
I think of my three-year-old and four years.
It's two little girls who are <unk> <unk> and bright and <unk> I want you to grow up in a world.
They were excited about the strong creatures they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice is going to become a lot easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sex violence against women like sport, <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We can change the radio station when we listen to songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money in order to go to the movies in another part when movies don't treat women more than as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting sports sports where athletes treat their classmates like <unk>
In any case, men, especially young men who can say, "No, I'm not going to post in your magazine, participate in your project, or work with you, until you don't have enough numbers of women, so much to participate in order to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also engage them as much as we are forced to overcome barriers to decision making.
Because we're not groupers that we are <unk> without these <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these tiny little acts of courage and hope that our decisions will get to the top, and the people in the power of <unk> and <unk> and music, <unk> the <unk> people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant.
We can also tell the courage to courage -- well, a bad thing, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be in <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, above all, because my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to address what happened.
A few kids were passionate about me when I was too young, and I didn't know kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like anything.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
I was going to get my voice, and after all, I didn't think I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I would fit in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that wasn't anything.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned how to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and 2009, I also found that if I was a little brave another woman could hear me and see me and see that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, and I'm trying to improve my thinking, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we could all be a little bit courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> to have visited <unk> or being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border, with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things in this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be lousy for a child with an immune immune system, is one of the most easily intervention in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century ago, but many of the kids involved in the outbreak -- they had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something allegedly <unk> autism.
But for a moment, it wasn't the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines were based on and marked by being a <unk> fraud by British Medical School.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know it, but millions of parents all over the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of the rise of autism in the time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it creates their whole professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates were made stable just three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
For our fundraising <unk> as <unk> they refer to autism as a epidemic as an epidemic -- as if I could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people about the Centers for Disease Control what is going on, tend to be based on sentences like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and <unk> <unk> to explain these numbers <unk>
But that kind of language didn't <unk> the fears of a young mother who is searching for his son of the two years of years, the visual contact.
If the diagnosis of the diagnosis had to figure out why they were so burnt at the beginning?
Why was the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we got here and where we have to go.
The first story begins with a psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked at <unk> worlds that looked like <unk> worlds, <unk> people around their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by waving their hands in front of their faces, but they were under panic by <unk> as when he didn't put his favorite toy in its usual place, without knowing them.
On the base of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very weird.
For the 1950s, as the main authority of the world on the subject, declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as we were <unk> from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the <unk> criteria for autism diagnosis was very <unk>
For example, we will give that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that the epilepsy, is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had become nine in every 10 children sent out by other doctors to her doctor's office and giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a <unk> form caused by cold parents and <unk>
These kids, he said, they have been very carefully kept on a refrigerator that doesn't make it happen.
At the same time, though, <unk> I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that they put together in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When her mother put one of his favorite records and he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad view of these skills and affirming things like the children were just <unk> what they had heard of their parents were desperate to win their approval approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Now, amazingly, it wasn't until the decade of 1970 that the researchers started to test <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of <unk> mothers was pretty stupid.
She and her husband was John <unk> and <unk> and they had an autistic child called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like without no support, without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Service Service that they needed more resources for autistic kids and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something you should have done 30 years before.
They launched a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
It took a suburb from London called <unk> to try to find the autistic kids in the community.
What they saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
In other ways, these kids didn't fit beautiful <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted before.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of his data.
How did no one ever realize these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article in <unk> and then then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation of the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> speak German, and he was <unk> for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school clinic in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for teaching children with learning are <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music with music, and the kids kept their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as <unk> disability for life that required ways of <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic like patients, Asperger's called them their little teachers, and he was dedicated to help in terms of education methods that were particularly suitable for them.
And in fact, Asperger's saw autism as a diverse continuum that there was an amazing variety of gifts, and disabilities.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they have always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in pop culture as a awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was more there even to say, that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
In the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association, of <unk> to expand the <unk> of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the '80s and the beginning of the '90s, their changes came into <unk> by using the limited model of <unk> by a broad and inclusive.
These changes not fell in a broken bag.
<unk> when I <unk> and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world to see an autistic adult for the first time.
